The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his [[Promos (professional wrestling)|promos]].&lt;ref name="nation" /&gt;

Later that night, he entered the Royal Rumble match and lasted until the final two before he was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. On March 29, at [[WrestleMania XIV]], he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on ''Raw is War'', the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply "The Nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse22.html |title=In Your House 22: Over the Edge 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock and The Nation then feuded with [[Triple H]] and [[D-Generation X]], with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the [[King of the Ring (1998)#King of the Ring bracket|1998]] [[King of the Ring tournament]], which the Rock won. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]], the Rock defeated [[Dan Severn]] in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a [[two out of three falls match]] at [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]] for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse23.html |title=In Your House 23: Fully Loaded 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a [[ladder match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], where the Rock lost the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1998/results/ |title=SummerSlam 1998 official results |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620164459/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1998/results/ |archive-date=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support during this time, causing him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members [[Mark Henry]] and D'Lo Brown, turning babyface in the process. Henry defeated him at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]], after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html |title=In Your House 24: Breakdown 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514225942/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html |title=In Your House 25: Judgment Day 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128011334/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html |archive-date=January 28, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock was then entered into the "Deadly Game" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The finals occurred at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], where the Rock defeated Vince McMahon's associate, [[Mick Foley|Mankind]], to win his first WWF Championship.&lt;ref name="rock1wwe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541401 |title=The Rock's first WWE Championship reign |publisher=WWE |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313105504/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541401 |archive-date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Survivor Series – Rock vs Mankind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1998/mainevent/ |title=The Rock def.

Mankind appeared to win the match when the Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw submission move, but Vince McMahon ruled that since the Rock did not tap out, he retained his title.&lt;ref name="corporation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/rockbottom98.html |title=In Your House 26: Rock Bottom results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock continued to feud with Mankind over the WWF Championship, which was traded back and forth between them. First, in the main event of the January 4, 1999 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Mankind defeated the Rock after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=WWE RAW (1999) – January 4, 1999 – RAW |date=January 4, 1999 |access-date=March 13, 2009 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archive-date=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then at the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] on January 24, the Rock regained the title in a brutal [["I quit" match|“I Quit” match]], a type of match that only ends if one of the combatants says “I quit” on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious mean streak in the Rock's character, this match went horribly wrong as at the end of the match the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being a risky amount (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the 5th shot, Mankind was still at ringside instead of being two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot which knocked a bloodied Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying "I Quit" from an earlier interview was played over the PA system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/results/ |title=Royal Rumble 1999 official results |publisher=WWE |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412 |title=The Rock's second WWE Championship reign |publisher=WWE |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309231225/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412 |archive-date=March 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31, during an episode of ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'', the Rock and Mankind participated in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]], a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match. After 20 minutes of chaotic brawling in the ring, the stands, a kitchen, the catering area, an office, the arena corridors and finally a basement loading area, Mankind pinned the Rock using a [[forklift truck]] to win the WWF title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/130790/20160204/wwe-looks-back-super-bowl-halftime-heat-rock-vs-mankind.htm|title=WWE Looks Back At Super Bowl 'Halftime Heat' With The Rock vs. Mankind|first=Mark|last=Lelinwalla|date=February 4, 2016|website=Tech Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This match was referred to as "Halftime Heat" as it was televised during halftime of that year's [[Super Bowl XXXIII|Super Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/99.htm |title=WWF results, 1999 |publisher=Angelfire |access-date=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304160001/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/99.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two faced off again, at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]], in a Last Man Standing match which ended in a draw, meaning Mankind retained the title.

The Rock's popularity continued to grow and audiences still cheered for him even though he was a heel.

On April 29, 1999, WWF aired the pilot episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', a term derived from one of the Rock's catchphrases. In the episode, the Rock continued his feud with The Corporate Ministry. This led to a match with Triple H, at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]], which the Rock won,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/overtheedge99.html |title=Over the Edge 1999 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a match for the WWF Championship against The Undertaker, at [[King of the Ring (1999)|King of the Ring]], which the Rock lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering99.html |title=King of the Ring 1999 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032104/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering99.html |archive-date=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rock then lost a number one contender's match to Triple H, at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]], after interference from [[Monty Sopp|"Mr. Ass" Billy Gunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/fullyloaded99.html |title=Fully Loaded 1999 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rock then defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass match at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]]. The Rock was also given the privilege of having his own signature match, like The Undertaker with the Buried Alive match, Kane with the Inferno Match and Mankind with the Boiler Room Brawl: the Brahma Bullrope match, a variant of a [[strap match]] was a normal singles match where the components are tied together with a rope used for cattle farming, and the rope and its attached cowbell could both be used as weapons. The Rock contested this match twice, both times in Texas (vs Triple H in Dallas, and vs [[Al Snow]] in Houston).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1999/results/ |title=SummerSlam 1999 official results |publisher=WWE |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620173807/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1999/results/ |archive-date=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], on January 23, 2000, the Rock entered the [[Royal Rumble match]] and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show.

[[File:WWF RAW 2001-10-15 The Rock at ringside.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Rock taunting an opponent at ringside]]
The Rock returned in late July 2001 when the WWF was feuding with rival promotions [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) during what's known as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] storyline. In reality, WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon and the WWF, and ECW had gone out of business in early 2001. Many former WCW and ECW wrestlers were then brought onto WWF television and formed [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]] to compete with WWF in storyline. The Alliance and Vince McMahon then both attempted to persuade the Rock to join their team. The Rock then aligned with McMahon and the WWF. The next month, the Rock defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], at [[SummerSlam (2001)|SummerSlam]], to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Championship]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="summerslam01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=The Rock vs. Booker T w/Shane McMahon for the WCW Championship |access-date=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621123202/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2001/mainevent/ |archive-date=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110223 |title=The Rock's first WCW Championship reign |access-date=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331155507/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/304454110223 |archive-date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later lost the title to [[Chris Jericho]] at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]].&lt;ref name="nomercy01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2001/results/ |title=No Mercy 2001 official results |access-date=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224055025/http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2001/results/ |archive-date=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321134 |title=Chris Jericho and The Rock's first World Tag Team Championship reign |access-date=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311084859/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321134 |archive-date=March 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next night on ''Raw'', he teamed with Jericho to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from [[The Dudley Boyz]]. The two then lost the tag titles to Booker T and Test on the November 1, 2001 episode of ''SmackDown!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://profightdb.com/wrestlers/the-rock-229.html?title=261 |title=The Rock: Profile &amp; Match Listing – Internet Wrestling Database (IWD) |website=profightdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rock defeated Jericho on the November 5 episode of ''Raw'' for his second WCW Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411028 |title=The Rock's second WCW Championship reign |access-date=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221192855/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wcwchampionship/30445411028 |archive-date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a "winner takes all" five-on-five elimination tag team match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, [[Rob Van Dam]], and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded "World Championship" following the Alliance's loss.&lt;ref name="survivorseries01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=The Rock, Chris Jericho, Big Show, Kane &amp; Undertaker def.

[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|thumb|left|The Rock defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin (left) in the latter's final match at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in March 2003]]
After failing to win a number one contendership for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], the Rock went into another program with Stone Cold Steve Austin. This led to a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]], which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won. The Rock won after delivering three consecutive ''Rock Bottoms'', ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match.&lt;ref name="slam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wm19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/ |title=WrestleMania XIX official results |access-date=March 21, 2008 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next night, ''Raw'' was billed as "The Rock Appreciation Night", in honor of his victory over Austin.

On April 3, at WrestleMania XXVII, the Rock opened the show by cutting a promo. After appearing in numerous backstage segments, the Rock came to ringside to restart the [[main event]] between Cena and The Miz as a No Disqualification match, after it had ended in a draw. As revenge for the ''Attitude Adjustment'' Cena had given him on ''Raw'', Rock hit Cena with the ''Rock Bottom'', allowing The Miz to pin him and retain the WWE Championship. After the match, Rock attacked Miz and hit him with the ''People's Elbow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/WrestleMania27/2011/04/03/17863646.html |title=The Rock costs Cena retained the championship at WrestleMania XXVII |date=April 3, 2011 |last=Bishop |first=Matt |access-date=April 4, 2011 |work=Slam!

The '''Mazda RX-7''' is a front/mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive, rotary engine-powered [[sports car]] that was manufactured and marketed by [[Mazda]] from 1978 to 2002 across three generations, all of which made use of a compact, lightweight [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].

The first generation of the RX-7, SA, was a two-seater 2 door [[hatchback]] [[coupé]]. It featured a 12A carbureted rotary engine as well as the option for a 13B with electronic fuel injection in later years.

The second generation of RX-7, known as the FC, was offered as a 2-seater coupé with a 2+2 option available in some markets, as well as in a convertible bodystyle. This was powered by the 13B rotary engine, offered in naturally aspirated or turbocharged forms.

The third generation of the RX-7, known as the FD, was also a 2-seater coupé. This featured a sequentially turbocharged 13B REW engine. This also featured the 2+2 seating option in some markets.

The RX-7 made ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] five times. More than 800,000 were manufactured over its lifetime.&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt;

The series 1 (produced from 1978–1980) is commonly referred to as the "SA22C" from the first alphanumerics of the [[vehicle identification number]]. Mazda's internal project number for what was to become the RX-7 was X605. In Japan it was introduced in March 1978, replacing the [[Mazda Savanna|Savanna RX-3]], and joined Mazda's only other remaining rotary engine-powered products, called the [[Mazda Cosmo|Cosmo]] which was a two-door luxury coupé, and the [[Mazda Luce|Luce]] luxury sedan.

The lead designer at Mazda was {{nihongo|Matasaburo Maeda|前田 又三郎|Maeda Matasaburō}}, whose son, [[:ja:前田育男|Ikuo]], would go on to design the [[Mazda Demio|Mazda2]] and the RX-7's successor, the [[Mazda RX-8|RX-8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-first=Nik | editor-last = Berg | first = Elliot | last = Lewis-George|title=Mazda Heroes #1 – Ikuo Maeda|journal=Zoom-Zoom Magazine|year=2013|issue=16|page=6|url=http://www.zoomzoommag.com.au/issue16_2013|access-date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition of the Savanna to a sports car appearance reflected products from other Japanese manufacturers. The advantage the RX-7 had was its minimal size and weight, and the compact rotary engine installed behind the front axle, which helped balance the front and rear weight distribution, and provide a low center of gravity.

In Japan, sales were enhanced by the fact that the RX-7 complied with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]], and Japanese buyers were not liable for yearly taxes for driving a larger car. The rotary engine had financial advantages to Japanese consumers in that the engine displacement remained below {{Convert|1500|cc|L|abbr=on}}, a significant determination when paying the Japanese annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]]; this kept the obligation affordable to most buyers, while having more power than the traditional engines having a straight cylinder configuration.

In May 1980, Mazda introduced a limited production run of special North American models known as the Leathersport Models. This package was essentially an uprated GS model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, special stripes on the exterior, and LS-only gold anodized wheels (with polished outer face and wheel rim). All LS editions came equipped with special LS-only full brown leather upholstery, leather wrapped steering wheel, leather wrapped shift knob, removable sunroof, LS-specific four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio with power antenna (though listed as a six-speaker stereo, as the two rear dual voice coil speakers were counted as four speakers in total), remote power door side mirrors, and other standard GS equipment. Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. Other GS options such as cassette tape deck, splash guards, padded center console arm rest and others could be added by the dealer. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colours: Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released. This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located rear license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' magazine a "[[Baroque architecture|Baroque depression]]."

[[File:1983 Mazda RX-7 GSL, front left.jpg|thumb|left|Mazda RX-7 Series 2 GSL (US)]]
[[File:MazdaRx-7GSL-SE-interior.jpg|thumb|left|Series 3 Interior (US)]]

The Series 2, referred to as the FB (produced from 1981–1983), had integrated plastic-covered bumpers, wide black rubber body side moldings, wraparound taillights and updated engine control components. While marginally longer overall, the new model was {{convert|135|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} lighter in federalized trim.&lt;ref name=RT82&gt;{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road &amp; Track's Road Test Annual &amp; Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January–February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-speed manual option was dropped for 1981 as well, while the gas tank grew larger and the dashboard was redesigned, including a shorter gear stick mounted closer to the driver.&lt;ref name=RT82 /&gt; In 1983, the {{cvt|130|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} speedometer returned for the RX-7. The GSL package provided optional four-wheel disc brakes, front ventilated (Australian model) and clutch-type rear [[limited slip differential]] (LSD). This revision of the SA22 was known in North America as the "FB" after the [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] mandated 17 digit Vehicle Identification Number changeover. For various other markets worldwide, the 1981–1985 RX-7 retained the 'SA22C' VIN prefix. In the UK, the 1978–1980 series 1 cars carried the SA code on the VIN but all later cars (1981–1983 series 2 and 1984–1985 series 3) carried the FB code and these first generation RX-7s are known as the "FB" only in Northern America. The license-plate surround looks much like Buhrer's "Styling Impressions".{{cn|date=April 2019}}

In Europe, the SA22 was mainly noticed for having received a power increase from the {{convert|105|PS|kW|abbr=on}} of the SA22; the 1981 RX-7 now had {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} on tap. European market cars also received four-wheel disc brakes as standard.&lt;ref name="AR83"&gt;{{cite book | title = Automobil Revue '83 | ref = AR83 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag, AG | language = de, fr | page = 363 | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 78 | date = March 10, 1983 | isbn = 978-3-444-06065-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1984 Mazda RX-7 (FB Series 3) coupe (2010-11-28).jpg|thumb|left|1984–1985 Mazda RX-7 (Series 3)]]

The Series 3 (produced 1984–1985) featured an updated lower front fascia. North American models received a different instrument cluster. GSL package was continued into this series, but Mazda introduced the GSL-SE sub-model. The GSL-SE had a [[Fuel injection|fuel injected]] {{Convert|1308|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Mazda Wankel engine#13B|13B RE-EGI]] engine rated at 135&amp;nbsp;hp (101&amp;nbsp;kW) and {{convert|180|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. GSL-SE models had much the same options as the GSL (clutch-type rear LSD and rear disc brakes), but the brake rotors were larger, allowing Mazda to use the more common lug nuts (versus bolts), and a new bolt pattern of 4x114.3mm (4x4.5"). Also, they had upgraded suspension with stiffer springs and shocks. The external oil cooler was reintroduced, after being dropped in the 1983 model-year for the controversial "beehive" water-oil heat exchanger.

The 1984 RX-7 GSL has an estimated 29 MPG (8.11 litres/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway/19 MPG (12.37 l/100&amp;nbsp;km) city. According to Mazda, its rotary engine, licensed by NSU-Wankel allowed the RX-7 GSL to accelerate from 0 to 80&amp;nbsp;km/h (50&amp;nbsp;mph) in 6.3 seconds. ''[[Kelley Blue Book]]'', in its January–February 1984 issue, noted that a 1981 RX-7 GSL retained 93.4% of its original sticker price.

In 1985, Mazda introduced the RX-7 Finale in Australia. This was the last of the series and brought out in limited numbers. The Finale featured power options and a brass plaque mentioning the number the car was as well as "Last of a legend" on the plaque. The finale had special stickers and a blacked out section between the window &amp; rear hatch.

The handling and acceleration of the car were noted to be of a high caliber for its day. The RX-7 had "live axle" [[Multi-link suspension|4-link]] rear suspension with [[Watt's linkage]], a 50:50 front and rear weight distribution, and weighed under {{cvt|1100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. It was the lightest generation of the RX-7 ever produced.{{cn|date=April 2019}} [[Mazda Wankel engine#12A|12A]]-powered models accelerated from 0–97&amp;nbsp;km/h (60&amp;nbsp;mph) in 9.2 seconds, and turned 0.779&amp;nbsp;''g'' (7.64&amp;nbsp;m/s²) laterally on a skidpad. The {{Convert|1146|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Mazda Wankel engine#12A|12A]] engine was rated at {{cvt|101|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm, allowing the car to reach speeds of over {{convert|120|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Because of the smoothness inherent in the Wankel rotary engine, little vibration or harshness was experienced at high engine speeds, so a buzzer was fitted to the [[tachometer]] to warn the driver when the 7,000 rpm redline was approaching.

The 12A engine has a long thin shaped combustion chamber, having a large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An engine driven pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This is done in the "thermal reactor" chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions, the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mazda.com/mazdaspirit/rotary/story/p4.html Development of Low-Emission Rotary Engines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116091730/http://www.mazda.com/mazdaspirit/rotary/story/p4.html |date=2010-01-16 }}", [[Mazda Motor Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Options and models varied from country to country. The gauge layout and interior styling in the Series 3 was only changed for the North American models. Additionally, North America was the only market to have offered the first generation of the RX-7 with the fuel-injected [[Mazda Wankel engine#13B-RESI|13B]], model GSL-SE. Sales of the first generation RX-7 were strong, with a total of 474,565 cars produced; 377,878 (nearly eighty percent) were sold in the United States alone. In 2004, ''[[Sports Car International]]'' named this car seventh on their list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 1970s]]. In 1983, the RX-7 would appear on ''Car and Driver'' magazine's Ten Best list for the first time in 20 years.

===Savanna RX-7 Turbo===
[[File:Mazda Savanna RX-7 101.JPG|thumb|left|Mazda Savanna RX-7 Turbo]]

Following the introduction of the first [[turbocharged]] rotary engine in the [[Mazda Luce|Luce]]/[[Mazda Cosmo|Cosmo]], a similar, also fuel injected and non-intercooled [[Mazda Wankel engine#Turbo|12A turbocharged]] engine was made available for the top-end model of the Series 3 RX-7 in Japan. It was introduced in September 1983.&lt;ref name=Moniteur&gt;{{cite journal | ref = Ballade | journal = Le Moniteur de l'Automobile | page = 40 | title = Ballade Japonaise: à la découverte des Mazda Turbo | trans-title = Japanese ballad: Discovering the Mazda Turbos | last = Dieudonne | first = Pierre | language = fr | volume = 34 | number = 784 | date = 1983-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was rated at {{convert|165|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} (JIS) at 6,500&amp;nbsp;rpm. While the peak power figures were only slightly higher than those of the engine used in the Luce/Cosmo, the new "Impact Turbo" was developed specifically to deal with the different exhaust gas characteristics of a rotary engine. Both rotor vanes of the turbine were remodelled and made smaller, and the turbine had a twenty percent higher speed than a turbo intended for a conventional engine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ballade|Dieudonne]], pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; The Savanna Turbo was short-lived, as the next generation of the RX-7 was about to be introduced.

The Series 4 (produced from 1986–1988) was available with a naturally aspirated, [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[Mazda Wankel engine#13B-DEI|13B-VDEI]] producing {{cvt|148|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} in North American spec. An optional [[turbocharged]] model, known as the Turbo II in the American market, was rated at 182&amp;nbsp;hp (136&amp;nbsp;kW). The Series 5 (1989–1992) featured updated styling and better engine management, as well as lighter rotors and a higher compression ratio 9.7:1 for the naturally aspirated model, and 9.0:1 for the turbo model. The naturally aspirated Series&amp;nbsp;5 FC was rated at {{cvt|162|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the Series&amp;nbsp;5 Turbo was rated at {{convert|203|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|265|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 3,500 rpm.

The second generation of the RX-7 ("FC", VIN begins JM1FC3 or JMZFC1), still known as the '''Mazda Savanna RX-7''' in Japan, featured a complete restyling which was reminiscent of the [[Porsche 924]] and [[Porsche 944|944]]. Mazda's stylists, led by Chief Project Engineer {{nihongo|Akio Uchiyama|内山 昭朗}},&lt;ref name="booksample"/&gt; focused on the Porsche 924 for their inspiration in designing the FC because the new car was being designed primarily for the American market, where the majority of first-generation of the RX-7 models had been sold.

This strategy was chosen after Uchiyama and others on the design team spent time in the United States studying owners of the earlier RX-7s and other sports cars popular in the American market. The Porsche 944 was selling particularly well at the time and provided clues as to what sports-car enthusiasts might find compelling in future RX-7 styling and equipment.

While the SA22 was a purer sports car, the FC tended toward the softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some similarities with the [[Mazda Cosmo#Series HB (1981–1989)|HB series Cosmo]]. Handling was much improved, with less of the oversteer tendencies of the SA22. The rear end design was vastly improved from the SA22's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with rack and pinion steering replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the SA22. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the FC. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5g or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. Another new feature was the Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS). The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. The system compensated for camber changes and provided anti-dive and anti-squat effects. 

The Turbo II model uses a turbocharger with a twin scroll design. The smaller primary chamber is engineered to cancel the turbo lag at low engine speeds. At higher revolutions, the secondary chamber is opened, pumping out 33% more power than the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo II also has an air-to-air intercooler which has a dedicated intake on the hood. The intake is slightly offset toward the left side of the hood.

Though about {{convert|800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} heavier and more isolated than its predecessor, the FC continued to win accolades from the press. The FC RX-7 was ''[[Motor Trend]]''{{'}}s [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]] for 1986, and the Turbo II was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best|10Best]] list for a second time in 1987.

In the Japanese market, only the turbocharged engine was available; the naturally-aspirated version was only available for export models. This can be attributed to insurance companies in many Western nations penalising turbocharged cars (thus restricting potential sales). Shortly after the discontinuance of the second generation of the RX-7 in 1992, an outright horsepower "arms race" broke out between sports car manufacturers, with higher and higher levels of power output required to meet buyer demands. This rising horsepower phenomena arose from the US [[CAFE standards]] remaining stable while engine technologies marched forward rapidly.

Mazda sold 86,000 RX-7s in the US alone in 1986, its first model year, with sales peaking in 1988.

Australian Motors Mazda introduced a limited run of 250 'Sports' model Series 4 RX-7s; each with no power steering, power windows or rear wiper as an attempt to reduce the weight of the car.

In Japan, a limited edition of the FC called Infini was available with production limited to only 600 cars for each year. Some special noted features for all Infini series are: infini logo on the rear, upgraded suspension, upgraded ECU, higher power output of the engine, lightened weight, 15-inch [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] aluminum alloy wheels, Infini logo steering wheel, aero bumper kits, bronze colored window glass, floor bar on the passenger side, aluminum bonnet with scoop, flare, and holder. The car was thought as the pinnacle of the RX-7 series (until the introduction of the FD). The Infini IV came with other special items such as black bucket seats, 16-inch [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels, Knee pads, and all the other items mentioned before. There are differing years for the Infini, which denoted the series. Series I was introduced in 1987, Series II was introduced in 1988, Series III was introduced in 1990, and Series IV was introduced in 1991. Series I and II came in White or Black exterior colours, Series III came in Forest Green only, and Series IV came in Forest Green or Noble Green exterior colours. There are only minor differences between the Series models, the biggest change which was from the Series II being an S4 and the Series III and IV being an S5 

===Convertible===
[[File:1988 Mazda Rx-7 Convertible (6272672059).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|1988 Mazda RX-7 convertible (FC)]]
Mazda introduced a convertible version of the RX-7 in 1988 with a naturally aspirated engine—introduced to the US market with ads featuring actor [[James Garner]], at the time featured in many Mazda television advertisements.

The convertible featured a removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding fabric rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching over to the right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers—thereby extending the driving season for the car with the top retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mazda Rotary-engined Cars: From Cosmo 110S to RX-8|last=Cranswick|first=Marc|publisher=Veloce Publishing Ltd|year=2016|isbn=978-1845849436 |pages=136}} {{ISBN|9781845849436}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit—a first in convertible production.

Several car magazines at the time lauded the convertible. Production ceased in 1991 after Mazda marketed a limited run of 500 examples for 1992 for the domestic market only. In Japan, the United Kingdom, and other regions outside the US, a turbocharged version of the convertible was available.

===10th Anniversary RX-7===
Mazda introduced the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a limited production model based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 units. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, tail light housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy seven-spoke wheels. There were two "series" of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series can be found on the exterior- the earlier "Series I" cars had a black "Mazda" logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all "Series II" cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped [[Momo (company)|MOMO]] steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed horn button) and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floor mats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or "bra"), and an aluminum under pan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2015/03/23/a-decade-of-delight-1988-mazda-rx-7-10th-anniversary-limited-edition-brochure/|title=A Decade of Delight: 1988 Mazda RX-7 10th Anniversary Limited Edition brochure|date=2015-03-23|author=Mark J.

===GTUs (1989–1990)===
In 1989, with the introduction of a face-lifted FC RX-7, and to commemorate the RX-7s IMSA domination, Mazda introduced a limited model labeled the GTUs. Starting with the lightweight base model, which came with manual windows, no rear wiper, the sunroof and A/C was dealer optioned, the GTUs.  added items found on the Turbo model such as four piston front brakes, rear ventilated brake rotors, vehicle speed sensing power steering, one-piece front chin [[spoiler (car)|spoiler]], cloth-covered Turbo model seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16 inch wheels, 205/55VR tyres, and a GTUs-only 4.300 Viscous-type limited slip differential (all other FC LSD's were 4.100). This allowed quicker acceleration from the non—turbo-powered 13B. Mazda built a rumored 100 cars in 1989-1990. There have not been 100 of these models found and registered. The only way to verify the GTUs model is through the door ID tag and firewall vin number. It is the only model with turbo ID tags and a non turbo vin. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/11/digestible-collectible-1989-mazda-rx7-gtus/|title=Digestible Collectible: 1989 Mazda RX-7 GTUs|date=2015-11-04|first=Chris|last=Tonn|access-date=2019-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) rear.JPG|thumb|left|Rear view]]

The third generation RX-7, '''FD''' (chassis code FD3S for Japan and JM1FD for the North America), featured an updated body design. The 13B-REW was the first-ever mass-produced [[twin-turbo#Sequential twin-turbo|sequential twin-turbocharger]] system to be exported from Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autocar.co.nz/autocar-news-app/mazda-pays-tribute-to-the-rx-7|title=Mazda pays tribute to the RX-7|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; boosting power to {{Convert|255|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in 1993 and finally {{Convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} by the time production ended in Japan in 2002.

The chief designer was {{nihongo|Yoichi Sato|佐藤 洋一|Satō Yōichi}}.&lt;ref name="booksample"&gt;{{cite book |last1=望月 |first1=澄男 |title=マツダRX-7 |date=2017 |publisher=Miki Press |location=Japan |isbn=978-4-89522-675-2 |pages=21 |url=http://www.mikipress.com/books/pdf/675.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219063556/http://www.mikipress.com/books/pdf/675.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-02-19 |language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key designer was Wu-huang Chin ({{lang|zh-Hant|秦無荒}}), a Taiwanese automotive artist who also worked on the [[Mazda MX-5 Miata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Design Central |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-30-mn-26006-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |date=30 January 1995 |quote=a concept car whose design was inked at Mazda Research &amp; Design in Irvine in 1989. It evolved into the curvy third-generation Mazda RX-7 for the 1993 model year. The design was the work of 37-year-old Wu-Huang Chin, above, who also was a member of the Miata design team.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, sales were affected by this series' non-compliance with Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] and Japanese buyers paid annual taxes for the car's non-compliant width. As the RX-7 was now considered an upper-level luxury sports car due to the increased width dimensions, Mazda also offered two smaller offerings, the [[Mazda MX-5 (NA)|Eunos Roadster]], and the [[Mazda MX-3|Eunos Presso]] hatchback.

The sequential twin turbocharging system, introduced in 1992, was extremely complex and was developed with the aid of [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]]. It was previously used on the exclusive-to-Japan [[Mazda Cosmo#JC|Cosmo JC Series]]. The system used two turbochargers, one to provide {{Convert|10|psi|bar||abbr=on}} of boost from 1,800&amp;nbsp;rpm. The second turbocharger activated in the upper half of the rpm range, during full throttle acceleration &amp;mdash; at 4,000&amp;nbsp;rpm to maintain {{convert|10|psi|bar||abbr=on}} until redline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.evo.co.uk/mazda/rx-7|title=Mazda RX-7 FD - review, history, prices and specs|website=Evo|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changeover process occurred at 4,500 rpm, with a momentary dip in pressure to {{Convert|8|psi|bar||abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/articles/2018/05/08/fd-mazda-rx-7-buyers-guide|title=Your definitive Mazda RX-7 FD buyer's guide {{!}} Hagerty Articles|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided semi-linear acceleration from a wide torque curve throughout the entire rev range under normal operation.

Under high speed driving conditions, the changeover process produced a significant increase in power output and forced technical drivers to adjust their driving style to anticipate and mitigate any over-steer during cornering.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The standard turbo control system used 4 control solenoids, 4 actuators, both a vacuum and pressure chamber, and several feet of preformed vacuum/pressure hoses, all of which were prone to failure in part due to complexity and the inherent high temperatures of the rotary engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A special high-performance version of the RX-7 was introduced in Australia in 1995, named the '''RX-7 SP'''. This model was developed to achieve [[homologation]] for racing in the [[1995 Australian GT Production Car Series|Australian GT Production Car Series]] and the [[1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour|Eastern Creek 12 Hour]] production car race.&lt;ref name=SPauction&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motoring.com.au/uber-rare-rx-7-at-shannons-103857/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160917181819/https://www.motoring.com.au/uber-rare-rx-7-at-shannons-103857/ | archive-date = 2016-09-17 | title = Uber rare RX-7 at Shannon's | work = motoring.com.au | publisher = carsales.com Limited | last = Robinson | first = James | date = 2016-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An initial run of 25 cars were made, and later an extra 10 were built by Mazda due to demand.&lt;ref name=Craigs&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cp_www.tripod.com/rotary/pg12.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150527051009/http://cp_www.tripod.com/rotary/pg12.htm | archive-date = 2015-05-27 |title= Mazda Australia's RX7-SP and RX7-SP2 (3rd Generation RX7) | date = 2001-03-22 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RX-7 SP was rated at {{Convert|277|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|357|Nm|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, a substantial increase over the standard model. Other changes included a race-developed carbon fibre nose cone and rear [[spoiler (car)|spoiler]], a carbon fibre 120&amp;nbsp;L fuel tank (as opposed to the 76&amp;nbsp;L tank in the standard car), a 4.3:1 final drive ratio, 17-inch wheels, larger brake rotors and calipers. A "three times more efficient" intercooler, a new exhaust, and a modified [[Engine Control Unit|ECU]] were also included.&lt;ref name=Craigs/&gt; Weight was reduced significantly with the aid of further carbon fibre usage including lightweight vented bonnet and [[Recaro]] seats to reduce weight to 1,218&amp;nbsp;kg (from 1,250&amp;nbsp;kg) making this model road-going race car that matched the performance of the rival [[Porsche 993|Porsche Carrera RS Club Sport]] for the final year Mazda officially entered.&lt;ref name=SPauction/&gt; The formula paid off when the RX-7 SP won the [[1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour]], giving Mazda the winning 12 hour trophy for a fourth straight year.&lt;ref name=SPauction/&gt; The winning car also gained a podium finish at the international tarmac rally Targa Tasmania months later.

In the United Kingdom, for 1992, customers were offered only one version of the FD, which was based on a combination of the US touring and the base model.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} For the following year, in a bid to speed up sales, Mazda reduced the price of the RX-7 to £25,000, down from £32,000, and refunded the difference to those who bought the car before that was announced. From 1992–1995, only 210 FD RX-7s were officially sold in the UK.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/tgs-guide-japan/mazda-rx-7-buying-guide-mk3-top-gear-japan-special#3|title=Top Gear's mk3 Mazda RX-7 buying guide|date=2018-03-12|work=Top Gear|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FD continued to be imported to the UK until 1996. In 1998, for a car that had suffered from slow sales when it was officially sold, with a surge of interest and the benefit of a newly introduced [[Single vehicle approval|SVA]] scheme, the FD would become so popular that there were more parallel and grey imported models brought into the country than Mazda UK had ever imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://garagedreams.net/history/complete-history-mazda-rx-7|title=The Complete History Of The Mazda RX-7 - Garage Dreams|date=2018-02-05|work=Garage Dreams|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about various trims and models is listed as follows:

*Series 6 (1992–1995) was exported throughout the world and had the highest sales.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In Japan, Mazda sold the RX-7 through its [[ɛ̃fini]] brand as the '''ɛ̃fini RX-7.'''

The Series 6 was rated at {{Convert|255|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|294|Nm|lb·ft|0|abbr=on}}.
*In 1993, three North American models were offered; the "base", the touring, and the R models. The touring FD included a sunroof, fog lights, leather seats, a rear window wiper and a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] Acoustic Wave system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The R (R1 in 1993 and R2 in 1994–95) models featured upgraded springs, [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]] shocks, an additional engine oil cooler, an aerodynamics package comprising a front lip and rear wing, and suede seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/looking-back-driving-a-bone-stock-1993-mazda-rx-7-r1/|title=Looking Back: Driving A Bone-Stock 1993 Mazda RX-7 R1|website=DrivingLine|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R2 differed from the R1 in that it had slightly softer suspension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1994, the interior received a small update to include a passenger air bag, and a PEG (performance equipment group) model was offered. This model featured leather seats and a sunroof.  It did not include the fog lights or Bose stereo of the touring package. In 1995, the touring package was replaced by the PEP (popular equipment package). The PEP package contained a rear wing, leather seats, sunroof and fog lights, but didn't have the Bose Stereo nor the rear window wiper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*In Europe, only 1,152 examples of the FD were sold through the official Mazda network. Only one model was available and it included twin oil-coolers, electric sunroof, cruise control and the rear storage bins in place of the back seats.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} It also has the stiffer suspension and strut braces from the R models.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Germany topped the sales with 446 cars, while UK is second at 210 and Greece third with 168.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The European models also received the 1994 interior facelift, with a passenger air bag.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

* Series 7 (produced from 1996–1998) included minor changes to the car. Updates included a simplified vacuum routing manifold and a 16-bit ECU which combined with an improved intake system netted an extra {{Convert|10|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This additional horsepower was only available on manual transmission cars as the increase in power was only seen above 7,000 rpm, which was the redline for automatic transmission equipped cars. The rear [[spoiler (car)|spoiler]] and tail lights were also redesigned. The Type RZ model was now equipped with larger brake rotors as well as 17 inch [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels. In Japan, the Series 7 RX-7 was marketed under the Mazda and ɛ̃fini brand name. The Series 7 was also sold in Australia, New Zealand and the UK. Series 7 RX-7s were produced only in right-hand-drive configuration.
* Series 8 (produced from 1998–2002) was the final series, and was only available in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were available on certain models, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling was made possible by a redesigned front fascia with larger openings. The seats, steering wheel, and instrument cluster were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and gained adjustability on certain models. Three horsepower levels are available: 255 PS for automatic transmission equipped cars, 265 PS for the Type RB, and 280 PS available on the top-of-the-line sporting models.

The high-end "'''Type RS'''" came equipped with Bilstein suspension and 17-inch wheels as standard equipment, and reduced weight to {{convert|1280|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Power was increased with the addition of a less restrictive [[muffler]] and more efficient turbochargers which featured abradable compressor seals, {{Convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6500 rpm and {{Convert|314|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 5000 rpm as per the maximum Japanese limit. The Type RS had a brake upgrade by increasing rotor diameter front and rear to {{convert|314|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and front rotor thickness from {{convert|22|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The Type RS version also sported a 4.30 final drive ratio, providing a significant reduction in its 0–{{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time. The gearbox was also modified, 5th gear was made longer to reduce cruising rpm and improve fuel efficiency. The very limited edition '''Type RZ''' version included all the features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight, at {{cvt|1270|kg|0|abbr=on}}. It also featured gun-metal colored [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels and a red racing themed interior. An improved [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average buyer.

Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s was the last model limited to 1,500 units. Dubbed the "'''Spirit R'''", they combined all the extra features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials with new exclusive features like cross-drilled brake rotors. Sticker prices when new were 3,998,000 yen for Type-A and B and 3,398,000 yen for Type-C. Mazda's press release said "The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7, boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history."
* There are three models of "Spirit R": the "Type A", "Type B", and "Type C". The "Type A" is a two-seater with a 5-speed manual transmission. It features lightweight red trim [[Recaro]] front seats as seen in the earlier RZ models. The "Type B" shares all features of the "Type A" except has a 2+2 seat configuration. The "Type C" is also a 2+2, but has a four-speed automatic transmission. Of the 1504 Spirit R's made, 1044 were Type A, 420 Type B and 40 Type C.&lt;ref name="en-rx7-fd3s-spirit-r"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gtr-registry.com/en-rx7-fd3s-spirit-r.php |title=Mazda RX-7 FD3S Spirit-R|website=GTR-Registry.com |access-date=3 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exclusive Spirit R paint color, Titanium Grey, adorned 719 of the 1504 cars produced.
In Japan the FD3S production span is categorized into 6 models: #1 from 1991/12, #2 from 1993/08, #3 from 1995/03, #4 from 1996/01, #5 from 1998/12 and #6 from 2000/10. The model number (1 to 6) actually shows as the first digit of the 6 digits long JDM VIN, for example in VIN# FD3S-ABCDEF the A is the model number. A total of 9 limited editions (type RZ in 1992/10 (300 cars), RZ 1993/10 (150), R-II Bathurst 1994/09 (350), R Bathurst X 1995/07 (777), RB Bathurst X 1997/01 (700), RS-R 1997/10 (500), RZ 2000/10 (325), R Bathurst R 2001/08 (650), Spirit R 2002/04 (1504)) and 2 special editions (Bathurst R 1995/02, R Bathurst 2001/12 (2174)) were produced.&lt;ref&gt;I Love FD3S RX-7, book in Japanese {{ISBN|4-87366-999-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazda official RX-7 chronology page http://www2.mazda.com/ja/stories/history/rx-7/chronology/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="en-mazda-rx7-fd3s-series-8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gtr-registry.com/en-mazda-rx7-fd3s-series-8.php |title=Mazda RX-7 FD3S Series 8 (Version V + Version VI)|website=GTR-Registry.com |access-date=3 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews and awards===
The FD RX-7 was ''[[Motor Trend]]'s'' [[Motor Trend Car of the Year#Import Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]]. When ''[[Playboy]]'' first reviewed the FD RX-7 in 1993, they tested it in the same issue as the [then] new [[Dodge Viper]]. In that issue, ''Playboy'' declared the RX-7 to be the better of the two cars. It went on to win ''Playboy's'' Car of the Year for 1993. The FD RX-7 also made ''[[Car and Driver]]'s'' Ten Best list for 1993 through 1995, for every year in which it was sold state-side. June 2007 ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' proclaimed "The ace in Mazda's sleeve is the RX-7, a car once touted as the purest, most exhilarating sports car in the world." After its introduction in 1991, it won the [[RJC Car of the Year|Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year]] award in Japan.

Handling in the FD was regarded as world-class, and it is still regarded as being one of the finest handling and the best balanced cars of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beautifullyengineered.tumblr.com/post/17955594936/the-mazda-rx-7-fd-is-beautifully-engineered|title=The Mazda RX-7 (FD) is Beautifully Engineered|website=beautifully engineered|access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jdmcarboy.com/category.php?id_category=1392{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=Jennica |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The continued use of the front-midship engine and drivetrain layout, combined with a 50:50 front-rear weight distribution ratio and low center of gravity, made the FD a very competent car at the limits.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

==Motorsport==
[[File:GT32010SCCARunoffsWinner78Robert Warkocki.jpg|thumb|right|An RX-7 GT3 car, winner of the GT3 class at the 2010 [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs]]]]
Racing versions of the first-generation RX-7 were entered at the prestigious [[24 hours of Le Mans]] endurance race. The first outing for the car, equipped with a ''[[Mazda Wankel engine#13B|13B]]'' engine, failed by less than one second to qualify in [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans|1979]]. The next year, a ''12A''-equipped RX-7 not only qualified, it placed 21st overall. That same car did not finish in 1981, along with two more 13B cars. Those two cars were back for 1982, with one 14th-place finish and another DNF. The RX-7 Le Mans effort was replaced by the [[Mazda 717|717C]] prototype for 1983.

Mazda began racing RX-7s in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GTU]] series in 1979. In its first year, RX-7s placed first and second at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], and claimed the GTU series championship. The car continued winning, claiming the GTU championship seven years in a row. The RX-7 took the [[IMSA GT Championship|GTO]] championship ten years in a row from 1982. In addition to this, a GTX version was developed, named the [[Mazda GTP|Mazda RX-7 GTP]]; this was unsuccessful, and the [[IMSA GTP|GTP]] version of the car was also unsuccessful. The RX-7 has won more IMSA races than any other car model. In the USA SCCA competition RX-7s were raced with great success by Don Kearney in the NE Division and John Finger in the SE Division. Pettit Racing won the GT2 Road Racing Championship in [[1998 IMSA GT Championship season|1998]]. The car was a '93 Mazda RX-7 street car with only bolt-on accessories. At season end Pettit had 140 points—63 points more than the second place team. This same car finished the Daytona Rolex 24-hour race four times.

The RX-7 also fared well at the [[Spa 24 Hours]] race. Three Savanna/RX-7s were entered in 1981 by [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]]. After hours of battling with several [[BMW 5 Series|BMW 530is]] and [[Ford Capri]]s, the RX-7 driven by [[Pierre Dieudonné]] and [[Tom Walkinshaw]] won the event. Mazda had turned the tables on [[BMW]], who had beaten Mazda's [[Mazda R100|Familia Rotary]] to the podium eleven years earlier at the same event. TWR's prepared RX-7s also won the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in [[1980 British Saloon Car Championship season|1980]] and [[1981 British Saloon Car Championship season|1981]], driven by [[Win Percy]].

Canadian born Australian touring car driver [[Allan Moffat]] was instrumental in bringing Mazda into the Australian touring car scene which ran to [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] regulations unique to Australia. Over a four-year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the [[1983 Australian Touring Car Championship]], as well as a trio of [[Bathurst 1000]] podiums, in [[1981 James Hardie 1000|1981]] (3rd with [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]]), [[1983 James Hardie 1000|1983]] (second with [[Yoshimi Katayama]]) and [[1984 James Hardie 1000|1984]] (third with former motorcycle champion [[Gregg Hansford]]). Privateer racer [[Peter McLeod]] drove his RX-7 to win the [[1983 Australian Endurance Championship]], while Moffat won the Endurance title in [[1982 Australian Endurance Championship|1982]] and [[1984 Australian Endurance Championship|1984]]. Australia's adoption of international [[Group A]] regulations, combined with Mazda's reluctance to homologate a Group A RX-7 (meaning that a base number of 5,000 had to be built, plus another 500 "evolution" models), ended Mazda's active participation in Australian touring car racing at the end of the 1984 season. Plans had been in place to replace the RX-7 with a [[Mazda 929]], but testing by Allan Moffat in late 1984 had indicated that the car would be uncompetitive and Mazda abandoned plans to race in Group A.

The RX-7 even made an appearance in the [[World Rally Championship]]. The car finished 11th on its debut at the [[RAC Rally]] in [[Wales]] in 1981. [[Group B]] received much of the focus for the first part of the 1980s, but Mazda did manage to place third at the 1985 [[Acropolis Rally]], and when the Group B was folded, its [[Group A]]-based replacement, the [[Mazda Familia|323 4WD]] claimed the victory at [[Swedish Rally]] in both 1987 and 1989.

==Revivals==
Mazda has made several references to a revival of the RX-7 in various forms over the years since the [[Mazda RX-8|RX-8]] was discontinued. In November 2012, [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5]] program manager Nobuhiro Yamamoto indicated that Mazda was working on a 16X based RX-7, with 300 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/new-mazda-rx-7-to-launch-by-2017.html|title=New Mazda RX-7 to launch by 2017|work=leftlanenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2012/11/4/Mazda-RX-7-to-Return-in-2017-7711438/|title=Mazda RX-7 to Return in 2017|work=CarBuzz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Mazda unveiled the RX-Vision [[concept car]] at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]], powered by a new rotary engine and featured design cues reminiscent to the third generation RX-7. A production-ready concept could have followed suit by 2017, marking 50 years since the revealing of Mazda's first rotary-powered sports car, the [[Mazda Cosmo#Series L10A/L10B (1967–1972)|Cosmo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-tokyo-motor-show/mazda-rx-vision-rotary-engined-sports-car-concept-revealed|title=Mazda RX-Vision rotary-engined sports car concept revealed|first=Mark|last=Tisshaw|date=2015-10-28|work=Autocar.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James' first television job was in 1991 on ''The New Candid Camera'', where he used his comedy timing and improvisation skills playing the actor that pulled the practical jokes on unsuspecting people. James appeared on television as the announcer for the [[MTV]] sports game show ''SandBlast'' from 1994-96. James later moved to Los Angeles and befriended [[Ray Romano]], and later guest-starred on a few episodes of Romano's hit [[CBS]] sitcom, ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. These appearances led to the development of his own sitcom, ''[[The King of Queens]]'', which ran on the same network from September 21, 1998 to May 14, 2007, James played [[working class]] parcel delivery man [[Doug Heffernan]] who works for a company known as IPS. He is married to [[Carrie Heffernan|Carrie]] ([[Leah Remini]]), a sharp-tongued, ambitious secretary at a [[Manhattan]] law firm who is far less content with working-class life in [[Queens]]. Her obsessive, vindictive father, [[Arthur Spooner|Arthur]] ([[Jerry Stiller]]), who is prone toward bizarre conduct, lives with them. For his work on the [[List of The King of Queens episodes#Season 8: 2005–2006|eighth season]], James was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/kevin-james|title=Kevin James Emmy Nominated|publisher=Emmys.com|access-date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James hosted the 2010 [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] on March 27, 2010, and was a nominee into the Arm Fart Hall of Fames of the [[2011 Kids' Choice Awards|next year's show]] as Kevin "Not-Quite-As-Good-As-[[Jack Black|Me]]" James; but lost to [[Josh Duhamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-james-host-kids-choice-20724|title=Kevin James to host Kids' Choice Awards|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=March 16, 2010|access-date=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/lat-bwkidduhame_lj21wvnc20110402195527-photo.html|title=Kevin James was robbed!|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
[[File:Kevin-james-at-set-burlington-mall.jpg|thumb|right|James on the set of ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'': Burlington Mall, Burlington, Massachusetts, 2008]]
After a cameo in ''[[50 First Dates]]'' in 2004, James made his starring film debut in the 2005 romantic comedy ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', alongside [[Will Smith]] and [[Eva Mendes]]. In 2006, he co-starred with his ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' colleague [[Ray Romano]] in the straight-to-video comedy ''[[Grilled (film)|Grilled]]'', and provided voice work in the [[animation|animated]] films ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' and ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]''. James co-starred with [[Adam Sandler]] in the comedies ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry]]'' (2007), ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008), and ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' (2009). The Latter film opened as the #1 film in North America with a weekend gross of $39 million, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critics' reviews for Paul Blart:Mall Cop|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/paul-blart-mall-cop/critic-reviews|work=metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually grossed $219 million from ticket and home video sales. James also appeared in ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'', which co-starred numerous ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumni and was even more universally panned, yet was highly successful at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critics' reviews for Grown Ups|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/grown-ups/critic-reviews|work=metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he had a lead role with [[Vince Vaughn]] in the comedy-drama ''[[The Dilemma]]'' and then with [[Rosario Dawson]] in ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'', which he wrote and produced. James also had the lead role in the 2012 [[mixed martial arts]] comedy film ''[[Here Comes the Boom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1237731-ufc-movie-here-comes-the-boom-starring-kevin-james-releases-new-trailer|title=MMA-Themed Movie 'Here Comes the Boom' Starring Kevin James Releases New Trailer|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=June 27, 2012 |access-date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He starred as well in the movie ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'' in 2015 and the following year in ''[[True Memoirs of an International Assassin]]'', directed by [[Jeff Wadlow]] and released by Netflix on November 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/true-memoirs-of-an-international-assassin-netflix-kevin-james-1201500854/|title=Netflix Buys Kevin James' 'True Memoirs of an International Assassin' - Variety|author=Ramin Setoodeh|work=Variety|access-date=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=True Memoirs of an International Assassin Premieres November 11 on Netflix |url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/true-memoirs-of-an-international-assassin-premieres-november-11-on-netflix|access-date=September 25, 2016|publisher=[[Netflix]] |date=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, James co-starred with [[Adam Sandler]] in another Netflix film, ''[[Sandy Wexler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-james-terry-crews-rob-913578|title=Kevin James, Terry Crews, Rob Schneider Join Adam Sandler's 'Sandy Wexler' (Exclusive)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
[[File:Kevin-james-dickste-freunde-berlin-17-01-11.jpg|thumb|James in 2011]]
In 2007, he was the grand marshal for the [[Pepsi 400]] promoting ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry]]'' and saying "Gentlemen, start your engines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KEVIN JAMES NAMED GRAND MARSHAL FOR 49TH ANNUAL PEPSI 400 AT DAYTONA |url=https://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Articles/2007/06/Kevin-James-Named-Grand-Marshal-For-49Th-Annual-Pepsi-400-At-Daytona.aspx |website=daytonainternationalspeedway.com |publisher=Daytona International Speedway |access-date=12 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did it again in June 2010 with friend and fellow actor [[Adam Sandler]] to promote ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'', in 2012 at the fall Talladega race to promote ''[[Here Comes the Boom]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Douglass |first1=Bryant |title=Kevin James to Serve as Grand Marshall |url=https://beyondtheflag.com/2012/09/29/kevin-james-to-serve-as-grand-marshall/ |website=beyondtheflag.com |publisher=FanSided, Inc. |access-date=12 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2013 at the Coke-Zero 400 with co-stars Sandler and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to promote ''[[Grown Ups 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bianchi |first1=Jordan |title=Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Shaquille O’Neal sing command to start engines |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2013/7/6/4499672/2013-nascar-daytona-international-coke-zero-400-Adam-Sandler-Kevin-James-Shaquille-ONeal |website=sbnation.com |publisher=Vox Media, LLC |access-date=26 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the 2007 Pepsi 400 command and June 2010 command at Michigan with Sandler have since been voted as two of the best and most memorable [[NASCAR]] commands in history by fans.

A web series titled ''Dusty Peacock'' produced by James and starring his brother [[Gary Valentine]] began streaming on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]] in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tilzy.tv/kevin-james-gary-valentine-get-reckless-on-dusty-peacock.htm |title=Kevin James, Gary Valentine Get Reckless on 'Dusty Peacock'|publisher=Tilzy.tv|date=July 17, 2009|access-date=July 23, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722140442/http://www.tilzy.tv/kevin-james-gary-valentine-get-reckless-on-dusty-peacock.htm|archive-date=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elephants''' are mammals of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Elephantidae]] and the largest existing land animals. Three [[species]] are currently recognised: the [[African bush elephant]], the [[African forest elephant]], and the [[Asian elephant]]. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order [[Proboscidea]]; extinct members include the [[mastodon]]s. The family Elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the [[mammoth]]s and [[straight-tusked elephant]]s. [[African elephant]]s have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long [[proboscis]] called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The [[column|pillar]]-like legs carry their great weight.

Elephants are scattered throughout [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]] and are found in different habitats, including [[savanna]]hs, forests, deserts, and [[marsh]]es. They are [[herbivorous]], and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be [[keystone species]], due to their impact on their environments.  Elephants have a [[fission–fusion society]], in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls, are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the [[Matriarchy|matriarch]].

Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased [[testosterone]] and aggression known as [[musth]], which helps them gain [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use [[infrasound]], and [[seismic communication]] over long distances. [[Elephant cognition|Elephant intelligence]] has been compared with that of [[primate]]s and [[cetacea]]ns. They appear to have [[self-awareness]], and appear to show [[empathy]] for dying and dead family members.

African elephants are listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and Asian elephants as [[Endangered species|endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the [[ivory trade]], as the animals are [[Poaching|poached]] for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include [[habitat destruction]] and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as [[working animal]]s in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in [[circus]]es. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and [[popular culture]].

==Etymology==
The word "elephant" is based on the [[Latin]] ''elephas'' ([[genitive]] ''elephantis'') ("elephant"), which is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐλέφας (''elephas'') (genitive ἐλέφαντος (''elephantos''&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;{{LSJ|e)le/fas|ἐλέφας|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;), probably from a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, likely [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].&lt;ref name=etymology&gt;{{cite dictionary|author=Harper, D|title=Elephant|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elephant|access-date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attested in [[Mycenaean Greek]] as ''e-re-pa'' (genitive ''e-re-pa-to'') in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2229199 |title=Ivory and horn production in Mycenaean texts |journal=Kosmos.

Elephants belong to the family [[Elephantidae]], the sole remaining family within the order [[Proboscidea]] which belongs to the superorder [[Afrotheria]]. Their closest [[extant taxon|extant]] relatives are the [[sirenia]]ns ([[dugong]]s and [[manatee]]s) and the [[hyrax]]es, with which they share the [[clade]] [[Paenungulata]] within the superorder [[Afrotheria]].&lt;ref name="Ozawa"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kellogg, M. |author2=Burkett, S. |author3=Dennis, T.

===Evolution and extinct relatives===
Over 180 extinct members and three major [[Adaptive radiation|evolutionary radiations]] of the order Proboscidea have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kingdon|first1=Jonathan|title=Mammals of Africa|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_07noCPc4kC|isbn=9781408189962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest proboscids, the African ''[[Eritherium]]'' and ''[[Phosphatherium]]'' of the late [[Paleocene]], heralded the first radiation.&lt;ref name="Gheerbrant"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gheerbrant, E. |year=2009 |title=Paleocene emergence of elephant relatives and the rapid radiation of African ungulates |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=106 |issue=26 |pages=10717–10721 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900251106 |pmid=19549873 |pmc=2705600|bibcode=2009PNAS..10610717G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eocene]] included ''[[Numidotherium]]'', ''[[Moeritherium]],'' and ''[[Barytherium]]'' from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as ''[[Phiomia]]'' and ''[[Palaeomastodon]]'' arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; One notable species of this epoch was ''[[Eritreum]] melakeghebrekristosi'' of the [[Horn of Africa]], which may have been an ancestor to several later species.&lt;ref name=link&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shoshani, J. |author2=Walter, R.

The former were related to ''Barytherium'' and lived in Africa and Eurasia,&lt;ref name=Sukumar17&gt;Sukumar, pp. 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter may have descended from ''Eritreum''&lt;ref name=link /&gt; and spread to North America.&lt;ref name=Sukumar17 /&gt;

The second radiation was represented by the emergence of the [[gomphothere]]s in the Miocene,&lt;ref name=Sukumar17 /&gt; which likely evolved from ''Eritreum''&lt;ref name=link /&gt; and originated in Africa, spreading to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Members of this group included ''[[Gomphotherium]]'' and ''[[Platybelodon]]''.&lt;ref name=Sukumar17 /&gt; The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The African ''[[Primelephas]] gomphotheroides'' gave rise to ''Loxodonta'', ''Mammuthus,'' and ''Elephas''. ''Loxodonta'' branched off earliest around the Miocene and [[Pliocene]] boundary while ''Mammuthus'' and ''Elephas'' diverged later during the early Pliocene. ''Loxodonta'' remained in Africa while ''Mammuthus'' and ''Elephas'' spread to Eurasia, and the former reached North America. At the same time, the [[Stegodontidae|stegodontids]], another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, China, southeast Asia, and Japan. Mammutids continued to evolve into new species, such as the [[Mastodon|American mastodon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[Pleistocene]], elephantids experienced a high rate of [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=Sukmar44/&gt; The Pleistocene also saw the arrival of ''[[Palaeoloxodon namadicus]]'', the largest terrestrial mammal of all time.&lt;ref name="Larramendi, A. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Larramendi A | year = 2015 | title = Shoulder height, body mass and shape of proboscideans | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | doi = 10.4202/app.00136.2014 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Loxodonta atlantica]]'' became the most common species in northern and southern Africa but was replaced by ''Elephas iolensis'' later in the Pleistocene. Only when ''Elephas'' disappeared from Africa did ''Loxodonta'' become dominant once again, this time in the form of the modern species. ''Elephas'' diversified into new species in Asia, such as ''E.&amp;nbsp;hysudricus'' and ''E.&amp;nbsp;platycephus'';&lt;ref name=Sukumar28 /&gt; the latter the likely ancestor of the modern Asian elephant.&lt;ref name=Sukmar44&gt;Sukumar, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mammuthus'' evolved into several species, including the well-known [[woolly mammoth]].&lt;ref name=Sukumar28&gt;Sukumar, pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species, which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components, such as the ''Palaeoloxodon antiquus''.&lt;ref name="Palkopoulou"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palkopoulou, E.|display-authors=etal|year=2018|title=A comprehensive genomic history of extinct and living elephants|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=115|issue=11|pages=E2566–E2574|doi=10.1073/pnas.1720554115|pmid=29483247|pmc=5856550}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Late Pleistocene]], most proboscidean species vanished during the [[Quaternary glaciation]] which [[Quaternary extinction event|killed off]] 50% of genera weighing over {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach.

[[File:Cretanelephant-petermaas.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of a Cretan dwarf elephant]]

Several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced [[insular dwarfism]]. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop [[Island gigantism|gigantism]] in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in [[Indonesia]], the [[Channel Islands of California]], and several islands of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=Sukumar31 /&gt;

''[[Elephas celebensis]]'' of [[Sulawesi]] is believed to have descended from ''[[Elephas planifrons]]''. ''[[Palaeoloxodon falconeri]]'' of [[Malta]] and [[Sicily]] was only {{convert|100|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and had probably evolved from the [[straight-tusked elephant]]. Other descendants of the straight-tusked elephant existed in [[Cyprus]]. Dwarf elephants of uncertain descent lived in [[Crete]], [[Cyclades]], and [[Dodecanese]] while dwarf mammoths are known to have lived in [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=Sukumar31&gt;Sukumar, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Columbian mammoth]] colonised the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] and evolved into the [[pygmy mammoth]]. This species reached a height of {{convert|120|–|180|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and weighed {{convert|200|–|2000|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}}. A population of small woolly mammoths survived on [[Wrangel Island]], now {{convert|87|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} north of the Siberian coast, as recently as 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Sukumar31 /&gt; After their discovery in 1993, they were considered dwarf mammoths.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Vartanyan, S.

Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest species, with males being {{cvt|304|-|336|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder with a body mass of {{cvt|5.2|-|6.9|MT|ST|1|abbr=on}} and females standing {{cvt|247|-|273|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder with a body mass of {{cvt|2.6|-|3.5|MT|ST|1|abbr=on}}. Male Asian elephants are usually about {{cvt|261|-|289|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and {{cvt|3.5|-|4.6|MT|ST|1|abbr=on}} whereas females are {{cvt|228|-|252|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and {{cvt|2.3|-|3.1|MT|ST|1|abbr=on}}. African forest elephants are the smallest species, with males usually being around {{cvt|209|-|231|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and {{cvt|1.7|-|2.3|MT|ST|1|abbr=on}}. Male African bush elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.&lt;ref name="Larramendi, A. 2015"/&gt;

===Bones===
The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.&lt;ref name=Shoshani68 /&gt; The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Somgrid, C.|title=Elephant Anatomy and Biology: Skeletal system|publisher=Elephant Research and Education Center, Department of Companion Animal and Wildlife Clinics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University|url=http://www.asianelephantresearch.com/about-elephant-anatomy-and-biology-p1.php#skeleton|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613191055/http://www.asianelephantresearch.com/about-elephant-anatomy-and-biology-p1.php#skeleton|archive-date=13 June 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head===
An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The skull contains air cavities ([[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]]) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a [[honeycomb]]-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy.&lt;ref name=Shoshani68&gt;Shoshani, pp. 68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; Lacking a [[lacrimal apparatus]], the eye relies on the [[harderian gland]] to keep it moist. A durable [[nictitating membrane]] protects the eye globe. The animal's [[Field of view|field of vision]] is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes.&lt;ref name="sense"&gt;{{cite web|author=Somgrid, C.|title=Elephant Anatomy and Biology: Special sense organs|publisher=Elephant Research and Education Center, Department of Companion Animal and Wildlife Clinics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University|url=http://www.asianelephantresearch.com/about-elephant-anatomy-and-biology-p4.php#Special|access-date=21 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729045534/http://www.asianelephantresearch.com/about-elephant-anatomy-and-biology-p4.php#Special|archive-date=29 July 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants are considered [[Dichromacy|dichromats]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yokoyama, S. |author2=Takenaka, N. |author3=Agnew, D.

=== Ears ===
Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or [[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]], contain numerous blood vessels called [[capillary|capillaries]]. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Narasimhan, A.|s2cid=121443269|year=2008|title=Why do elephants have big ear flaps?|journal=Resonance|volume=13|issue=7|pages=638–47|doi=10.1007/s12045-008-0070-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 [[Hertz|kHz]] (in close proximity to the [[Soprano]] [[C (musical note)|C]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reuter, T.|author2=Nummela, S.|author3=Hemilä, S.|year=1998|title=Elephant hearing|journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=104|issue=2|pages=1122–23|url=http://roadecology.ucdavis.edu/%5C/pdflib/Winter2005/Rodwell_Reuter_ele_ear.pdf|doi=10.1121/1.423341|pmid=9714930|bibcode=1998ASAJ..104.1122R|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207065356/http://roadecology.ucdavis.edu/pdflib/Winter2005/Rodwell_Reuter_ele_ear.pdf|archive-date=7 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trunk ===
{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical

}}
The trunk, or [[proboscis]], is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early [[Fetus|fetal]] life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate [[muscle fascicle]]s, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into [[Dorsoventral|dorsals, ventrals]], and [[Lateral and medial|laterals]] while the latter are divided into [[Transverse plane|transverse]] and [[wikt:radiate|radiating]] muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The [[nasal septum]] is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. [[Cartilage]] divides the nostrils at the base.&lt;ref name=Shoshani74&gt;Shoshani, pp. 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[muscular hydrostat]], the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions. The muscles work both with and against each other. A unique proboscis nerve – formed by the [[maxillary nerve|maxillary]] and [[facial nerve]]s – runs along both sides of the trunk.&lt;ref name=trunk /&gt;

Elephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, [[olfaction]], touching, grasping, and sound production.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a [[bloodhound]].&lt;ref name=Sukumar149 /&gt; The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants,&lt;ref name=Kingdon9&gt;Kingdon, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and lift up to {{convert|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; It can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice,&lt;ref name=Kingdon9 /&gt; and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} and dig for water under mud or sand.&lt;ref name=Kingdon9 /&gt; Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right.&lt;ref name="trunk"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Martin, F.|author2=Niemitz C. |year=2003|title="Right-trunkers" and "left-trunkers": side preferences of trunk movements in wild Asian elephants (''Elephas maximus'')|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=117|issue=4|pages=371–79|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.117.4.371|pmid=14717638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their bodies.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding {{convert|8.5|L|gal|abbr=on}} of water in its trunk.&lt;ref name=Shoshani74 /&gt; They will also spray dust or grass on themselves.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]].&lt;ref name=snorkel /&gt;

The African elephant has two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth.&lt;ref name=Shoshani38 /&gt; Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks.&lt;ref name=Shoshani74 /&gt; Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival,&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones.

=== Teeth ===
{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical

}}
Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the [[incisor]]s, known as the [[tusk]]s, 12 [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous]] [[premolar]]s, and 12 [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]. Unlike most mammals, which [[Tooth development|grow baby teeth]] and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are [[polyphyodont]]s that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.&lt;ref name=Shoshani70&gt;Shoshani, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tusks ====
The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous [[milk teeth]] at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about {{convert|17|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth [[tooth enamel|enamel]] cap that eventually wears off. The [[dentin]]e is known as [[ivory]] and its [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral [[calcite]]. Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp]] and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.&lt;ref name=Shoshani71 /&gt;

Like humans, who are typically [[Handedness|right- or left-handed]], elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to {{convert|300|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Shoshani71 /&gt; but those of males tend to be thicker.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90&amp;nbsp;kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over {{convert|100|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Still Life" by Bryan Christy. ''National Geographic Magazine'', August 2015, pp. 97, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all.&lt;ref name=Shoshani71&gt;Shoshani, pp. 71–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clutton-Brock, J.|year=1986|title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals|publisher=British Museum (Natural History)|page=208|isbn=978-0-521-34697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was {{convert|302|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|39|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.

=== Skin ===
[[File:Forest elephant group 4 (6987537249).jpg|thumb|An African forest elephant covering its skin with mud]]
An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, [[anus]], and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, [[Sex organ|genitals]] and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.&lt;ref name=Shoshani66&gt;Shoshani, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Their hair is thought to be for [[thermoregulation]], helping them lose heat in their hot environments.&lt;ref name="Elephanthair"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myhrvold |first1=C. L. |last2=Stone |first2=H. A. |last3=Bou-Zeid |first3=E. |title=What Is the Use of Elephant Hair? |journal=PLoS ONE |date=10 October 2012 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=e47018 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0047018|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from [[ultraviolet]] light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular [[mud bath]]s to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust.

Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low [[surface-area-to-volume ratio]], which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.&lt;ref name=Shoshani66 /&gt;

=== Legs, locomotion, and posture ===
[[File:Elephant Walking animated.gif|thumb|An Asian elephant walking]]
To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have [[cancellous bone]] in place of [[medullary cavity|medullary cavities]]. This strengthens the bones while still allowing [[haematopoiesis]].&lt;ref name=Shoshani69&gt;Shoshani, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.&lt;ref name="cushion"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weissengruber, G.

Elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the [[ulna]] and [[Radius (bone)|radius]] are fixed in [[pronation]]; the "palm" of the manus faces backward.&lt;ref name=Shoshani69 /&gt; The [[Pronator quadratus muscle|pronator quadratus]] and the [[Pronator teres muscle|pronator teres]] are either reduced or absent.&lt;ref&gt;Shoshani, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or "cushion pads" beneath the [[Manus (anatomy)|manus]] or [[Pes (anatomy)|pes]], which distribute the weight of the animal.&lt;ref name=cushion /&gt; They appear to have a [[Sesamoid bone|sesamoid]], an extra "toe" similar in placement to a [[giant panda]]'s extra "thumb", that also helps in weight distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=23 December 2011 |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/12/elephants-have-a-sixth-toe.html? |title=Elephants Have a Sixth 'Toe' |publisher=ScienceMag.org |author=Pennisi, E. |date=22 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113093919/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/12/elephants-have-a-sixth-toe.html |archive-date=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.&lt;ref name=Shoshani38 /&gt;

[[File:Em - Loxodonta africana heart - GMZ 2.jpg|thumb|right|African elephant heart in a jar]]
The brain of an elephant weighs {{convert|4.5|–|5.5|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|1.6|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The [[cerebrum]] and [[cerebellum]] are well developed, and the [[temporal lobe]]s are so large that they bulge out laterally.&lt;ref name=Shoshani78 /&gt; The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use.&lt;ref name=evolution /&gt; The [[larynx]] of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. The [[vocal fold]]s are long and are attached close to the [[epiglottis]] base. When comparing an elephant's vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant's are longer, thicker, and have a larger cross-sectional area.

The African bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry [[savanna]]hs, [[desert]]s, [[marsh]]es, and lake shores, and in elevations from sea level to mountain areas above the [[snow line]]. Forest elephants mainly live in [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests|equatorial forests]] but will enter [[gallery forest]]s and [[ecotone]]s between forests and savannahs.&lt;ref name=Shoshani42&gt;Shoshani, pp. 42–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily inhabiting dry [[Deccan thorn scrub forests|thorn-scrub forests]] in southern India and Sri Lanka and [[evergreen forest]]s in [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]].&lt;ref name=Asian&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shoshani, J. |author2=Eisenberg, J.

Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered [[keystone species]]. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At [[Mount Elgon]], elephants excavate caves that are used by [[ungulate]]s, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects.&lt;ref name=Shoshani226 /&gt; Elephants are important [[Seed dispersal|seed dispersers]]; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on [[germination]].

At [[Murchison Falls National Park]] in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to [[surface runoff|run off]], leading to [[erosion]].&lt;ref name=Shoshani124&gt;Eltringham, pp. 124–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social organisation ===
Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] family groups, some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three mothers and their dependent offspring, and are led by the [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] which is often the eldest female.&lt;ref name=Sukumar175 /&gt; She remains leader of the group until death&lt;ref name=African /&gt; or if she no longer has the energy for the role;&lt;ref name=Kingdon53&gt;Kingdon, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal [[corticosterone]] ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Harris, M. |author2=Sherwin, C. |author3=Harris, S. |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf|title=Defra final report on elephant welfare|publisher=University of Bristol|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present.&lt;ref name=African /&gt; One study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under-react to severe danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McComb, K. |author2=Shannon, G. |author3=Durant, S.

The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In the case of elephants in [[Amboseli National Park]], Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups. During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral" subpopulations.&lt;ref name=Sukumar175&gt;Sukumar, pp. 175–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group.&lt;ref name=Sukumar175 /&gt; Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.&lt;ref name=Sukumar175 /&gt;

The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals. Bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize, they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.&lt;ref name=Sukumar179 /&gt;

Male elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships.&lt;ref name="O'Connell-Rodwell"&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Connell-Rodwell, C.|date=November 2010|title=How Male Elephants Bond|publisher=Smithsonian.com|access-date=4 June 2017|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-male-elephants-bond-64316480/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[dominance hierarchy]] exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily.

=== Sexual behaviour ===

==== Musth ====
{{Main|Musth}}
[[File:2005-tusker-musth-crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bull in musth]]

Adult males enter a state of increased [[testosterone]] known as [[musth]]. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the [[Temporin|temporal gland]] that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his [[penile sheath|sheath]], which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.&lt;ref name=Sukumar100 /&gt;

Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.&lt;ref name=Sukumar100&gt;Sukumar, pp. 100–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mating ====
[[File:Elephantsmating.jpg|thumb|Bull mating with a member of a female group]]

Elephants are [[Polygyny|polygynous]] breeders,&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[animal sexual behaviour|copulations]] are most frequent during the peak of the wet season.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals ([[pheromone]]s) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate.

=== Birth and development ===
[[File:Loxodontacyclotis.jpg|thumb|An African forest elephant mother bathing with her calf]]
[[Gestation]] in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, pp. 259–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Calves are born {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Shoshani106&gt;Moss, pp. 106–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur.&lt;ref name=pregnancy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.am/eng/videos/825.html|title=Rare elephant twins born in northern Kwa-Zulu Natal|work=news.am}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five [[corpus luteum]]s (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk.&lt;ref name="pregnancy"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lueders, I.|author2=Niemuller, C. |author3=Rich, P. |author4=Gray, C. |author5=Hermes, R. |author6=Goeritz, F. |author7=Hildebrandt, T. B. |year=2012|title=Gestating for 22 months: luteal development and pregnancy maintenance in elephants|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=279|issue=1743|pages=3687–96|pmid=22719030|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1038|pmc= 3415912}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, newborn elephants are [[precocial]] and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd.&lt;ref name=Sukumar126 /&gt; A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. [[Alloparenting]] – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old.&lt;ref name=Shoshani106 /&gt;

For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.&lt;ref name=Sukumar126 /&gt;

For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.&lt;ref name=Sukumar126&gt;Sukumar, pp. 126–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Play behaviour in calves differs between the sexes; females run or chase each other while males play-fight. The former are [[sexually mature]] by the age of nine years&lt;ref name=Shoshani106 /&gt; while the latter become mature around 14–15 years.&lt;ref name=Sukumar179 /&gt; Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant Life Cycle|publisher=ElephantsForever.co.za|url=http://www.elephantsforever.co.za/life-cycle.html |access-date=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant Life Cycle – Adolescence|publisher=ElephantsForever.co.za|url=http://www.elephantsforever.co.za/life-cycle-adolescence.html |access-date=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age.&lt;ref name=Shoshani70 /&gt; [[Lin Wang]], a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=War veteran elephant dies|work=BBC News|date=26 February 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2800737.stm|access-date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communication ===
[[File:Three elephant's curly kisses.jpg|thumb|Asian elephants greeting each other by inter-twining their trunks]]

Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.&lt;ref&gt;Payne and Langbauer, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.&lt;ref&gt;Payne and Langbauer, pp. 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elephants produce several sounds, usually through the [[larynx]], though some may be [[Vocal resonation|modified]] by the trunk.&lt;ref name=Shoshani120 /&gt; Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression.&lt;ref name=Estes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shoshani120&gt;Payne and Langbauer, pp. 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting elephants may roar or squeal, and wounded ones may bellow.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rumble (noise)|Rumbles]] are produced during mild arousal&lt;ref name=Sukumar145 /&gt; and some appear to be [[infrasound|infrasonic]].&lt;ref name=Payne /&gt; These calls occur at frequencies less than 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="infrasonic"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Herbest, C.T.; M; Stoeger, A; Frey, R; Lohscheller, J; Titze, I.R.; Gumpenberger, M; Fitch, W.T.|s2cid=32792564|year=2012|title=How Low Can You Go?

[[File:Loxodonta africana oral rumble visualized with acoustic camera (25fps) - pone.0048907.s003.ogv|thumb|right|Rumble visualised with acoustic camera]]

At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact calls are soft, [[Modulation|unmodulated]] sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a "contact answer" call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the "mating pandemonium".&lt;ref name=Sukumar145&gt;Sukumar, pp. 142–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

From various experiments, the elephant larynx is shown to produce various and complex vibratory phenomena. During [[in vivo]] situations, these phenomena could be triggered when the vocal folds and vocal tract interact to raise or lower the fundamental frequency.&lt;ref name="infrasonic"/&gt; One of the vibratory phenomena that occurred inside the larynx is alternating A-P (anterior-posterior) and P-A traveling waves, which happened due to the unusual larynx layout. This can be characterized by its unique glottal opening/closing pattern. When the trachea is at pressure of approximately 6 kPa, [[phonation]] begins in the larynx and the laryngeal tissue starts to vibrate at approximately 15 kPa. Vocal production mechanisms at certain frequencies are similar to that of humans and other mammals and the laryngeal tissues are subjected to self-maintained oscillations. Two biomechanical features can trigger these traveling wave patterns, which are a low fundamental frequency and in the vocal folds, increasing longitudinal tension.&lt;ref name="vibratorypatterns"/&gt;

Elephants are known to [[seismic communication|communicate with seismics]], vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in [[marine mammal]]s like [[toothed whale]]s and sirenians. A unique [[sphincter]]-like muscle around the [[ear canal]] constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.&lt;ref name="seismic"&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Connell-Rodwell, E.O.|year=2007|title=Keeping an "ear" to the ground: seismic communication in elephants|journal=Physiology|volume=22|issue=4|pages=287–94|doi=10.1152/physiol.00008.2007|pmid=17699882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Connell-Rodwell C. E. |author2=Arnason, B. |author3=Hart, L.

African elephants were listed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two forms.&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;{{cite iucn|author1=Blanc, J.|year=2008|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12392/0|title=''Loxodonta africana''|access-date=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3&amp;nbsp;million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0&amp;nbsp;million.

African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities. As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or [[Species translocation|translocation]]. Large-scale [[culling]]s ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe abandoned the practice. In 1989, the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, [[Trophy hunting|sport hunting]] of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, [[Gabon]], Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, [[Tanzania]], Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies.&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt; In June 2016, the [[First Lady of Kenya]], [[Margaret Kenyatta]], helped launch the East Africa Grass-Root Elephant Education Campaign Walk, organised by elephant conservationist [[Jim Nyamu]]. The event was conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephants and rhinos, to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.&lt;ref name="StarNews"&gt;Star website.

In 2008, the IUCN listed the Asian elephant as [[endangered]] due to a 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years&lt;ref name="IUCN2"&gt;{{cite iucn |author1=Choudhury, A. |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/7140/0 |title=''Elephas maximus'' |access-date=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while CITES lists the species under Appendix I.&lt;ref name=IUCN2 /&gt; Asian elephants once ranged from [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] (the subspecies [[Syrian elephant|''Elephas maximus asurus'']]), to China (up to the [[Yellow River]])&lt;ref name=Shoshani174&gt;Daniel, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; and Java.

Following the bans, unemployment rose in India and China, where the ivory industry was important economically. By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not badly affected.&lt;ref name=Shoshani202 /&gt; Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and [[Malawi]] wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes.&lt;ref name=ivory /&gt;

The ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of Africa.&lt;ref name=Shoshani202 /&gt; In January 2012, 650 elephants in [[Bouba Njida National Park]], Cameroon, were killed by [[Chad]]ian raiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Celeste|title=86 elephants killed in Chad poaching massacre|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/19/86-elephants-chad-poaching-massacre|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 September 2015|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been called "one of the worst concentrated killings" since the ivory ban.&lt;ref name="ivory" /&gt; Asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade, as females usually lack tusks.

Other threats to elephants include [[habitat destruction]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]].&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt; The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation.&lt;ref name=IUCN2 /&gt; One proposed solution is the provision of 'urban corridors' which allow the animals access to key areas.&lt;ref name=ng&gt;{{cite web|last=Steyn|first=Paul|title=Urban Wildlife Corridors Could Save Africa's Free-Roaming Elephants|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/12/elephant-crossing-urban-wildlife-corridors-could-save-africas-free-roaming-elephants/|work=A Voice for Elephants|publisher=National Geographic|date=12 December 2013|access-date=23 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113008/http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/12/elephant-crossing-urban-wildlife-corridors-could-save-africas-free-roaming-elephants/|archive-date=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Working animal ===
{{See also|Captive elephants}}
[[File:Elefant pune.jpg|thumb|Working elephant as transport]]

Elephants have been [[working animal]]s since at least the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life.&lt;ref name=Shoshani149 /&gt; They were [[Mela shikar|traditionally captured with traps and lassos]], but since 1950, [[sedative|tranquillisers]] have been used.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, pp. 120–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals of the Asian species have been often trained as working animals. Asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around [[national park]]s, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions.&lt;ref name="Shoshani149" /&gt; In northern [[Thailand]], the animals are used to digest coffee beans for [[Black Ivory coffee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Topper, R|date=15 October 2012|title=Elephant Dung Coffee: World's Most Expensive Brew Is Made With Pooped-Out Beans|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=10 December 2012|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/elephant-dung-coffee-black-ivory_n_1968096.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands.&lt;ref name="Shoshani149"&gt;McNeely, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes.&lt;ref&gt;Easa, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under [[The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960|The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bist, S.

In both Myanmar and Thailand, [[deforestation]] and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Thomas Fuller |title=Unemployed, Myanmar's Elephants Grow Antsy, and Heavier |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-logging-elephants-unemployment.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 January 2016 |access-date=31 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ad031e/ad031e0r.htm |title=The elephant situation in Thailand and a plea for co-operation |author=Roger Lohanan |date= February 2001 |access-date=31 January 2016 |publisher=[[FAO]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of working elephants has also been attempted in Africa.

=== Warfare ===
&lt;!-- Please do not add any more examples to this section. This subject already has its own article --&gt;
{{Main|War elephant}}
{{See also|Execution by elephant}}
[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gemälde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Zama]] by [[Henri-Paul Motte]], 1890]]

Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.&lt;ref name=Shoshani146 /&gt;

One of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (written in the 4th century BC, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC). They were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the [[Pandava]]s or [[Kaurava]]s. During the [[Magadha Kingdom]] (which began in the 6th century BC), elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the [[Nanda Empire|Nandas]] (5th and 4th centuries BC) army while 9,000 may have been used in the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan army]] (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, pp. 59–64.&lt;/ref&gt; From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to [[Iran|Persia]]&lt;ref name=Shoshani146 /&gt; and east to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=SEA /&gt; The Persians used them during the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC)&lt;ref name=Shoshani146 /&gt; while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century.&lt;ref name="SEA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Griffin, B|year=2004|contribution=Elephants: From the Sacred to the Mundane|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 1|editor=Gin Ooi, K.|pages=487–89|isbn=978-1-57607-770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 326 B.C. Indian campaign, [[Alexander the Great]] confronted elephants for the first time, and suffered heavy casualties. Among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file Macedonian soldiers to continue the Indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warfare in Ancient Greece|last=Everson|first=Tim|publisher=The History Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7524-9506-4|location=Brimscombe Port}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]] (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in [[Nubia]]. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the [[classical antiquity|classical period]]. The Greek king [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal]] took elephants across the [[Alps]] during his war with the Romans and reached the [[Po Valley]] in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.&lt;ref name="Shoshani146"&gt;Wylie (2000), pp. 146–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. With time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by Romans and [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Zoos and circuses ===
{{See also|Captive elephants}}

Elephants were historically kept for display in the [[menagerie]]s of [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Elephants in ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in [[gladiator]] events. In the [[Modern history|modern era]], elephants have traditionally been a major part of [[zoo]]s and [[circus]]es around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably [[Jumbo]] (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoshani, pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. In the year 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population was in North America, which had an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans were known to exist in Europe, and Japan had around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.&lt;ref name=Shoshani184&gt;Tuttle, pp. 184–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sterm, A.|date=28 February 2005|title=Elephant deaths at zoos reignite animal debate: Zoo supporters cite conservation, activists cite confined spaces|publisher=MSNBC/Reuters|url=http://www.elephants.com/media/MSNBC_2_28_05.htm|access-date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants have been recorded displaying [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypical behaviours]] in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Harris, M. |author2=Sherwin, C. |author3=Harris, S. |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf|title=Defra Final Report on Elephant Welfare|publisher=University of Bristol|date=10 November 2008|access-date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mott, M.|date=11 December 2008|title=Wild elephants live longer than their zoo counterparts|publisher=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-zoo-elephants.html|access-date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the [[Humane Society of the United States]] has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circus Myths: The true cruelty under the big top|publisher=Humane Society of the United States|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/circuses_entertainment/facts/circus_myths.html|date=25 September 2009|access-date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus CEO [[Kenneth Jeffrey Feld|Kenneth Feld]] acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called [[Elephant goad|bull hooks]] or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices harm elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pickler, N.|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20090304/UPDATES01/903040429/Circus-CEO-says-elephants-struck-not-hurt|title=Circus CEO says elephants are struck, but not hurt|agency=Associated Press|date=4 March 2009|access-date=25 October 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120082119/http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20090304/UPDATES01/903040429/Circus-CEO-says-elephants-struck-not-hurt|archive-date=20 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment.

Africa, in particular, contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals, especially in the [[Sahara]] and southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, the animals are depicted as [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] shrines and temples.&lt;ref name=Shoshani158 /&gt; Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience of them.&lt;ref&gt;Kingdon, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], who kept the animals in captivity, depicted anatomically accurate elephants on [[mosaic]]s in [[Tunisia]] and Sicily. At the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]], when Europeans had little to no access to the animals, elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures. They were often depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves. Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches. As more elephants began to be sent to European kings as gifts during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Despite this, some Europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Ernst]]'s 1921 [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painting, ''[[The Elephant Celebes]],'' depicts an elephant as a [[silo]] with a trunk-like hose protruding from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Klinsöhr-Leroy, C. |author2=Grosenick, U. |year=2004|title=Surrealism|publisher=Taschen|page=50|isbn=978-3-8228-2215-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The [[Mbuti people]] of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants.&lt;ref name=Shoshani158&gt;McNeely, pp. 158–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas existed among other African societies, who believed that their chiefs would be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of [[Igbo-Ukwu]], near the [[Niger Delta]], buried their leaders with elephant tusks.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The animals' religious importance is only [[Totemism|totemic]] in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as [[Airavata]], the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows.&lt;ref name=Shoshani158 /&gt; One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed [[Ganesha]], is ranked equal with the supreme gods [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Brahma]].&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires.&lt;ref name=Shoshani158 /&gt; In Buddhism, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is said to have been a [[White elephant (animal)|white elephant]] reincarnated as a human.&lt;ref&gt;Sukumar, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]]ic tradition, the year 570 when [[Muhammad]] was born is known as the [[Year of the Elephant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Haykal, M. H.|year=2008|title=The Life of Muḥammad|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|page=52|isbn=978-983-9154-17-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.&lt;ref name=Shoshani158 /&gt;

Elephants are ubiquitous in Western [[popular culture]] as emblems of the exotic, especially since – as with the [[giraffe]], [[hippopotamus]] and [[rhinoceros]] – there are no similar animals familiar to Western audiences.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 73" /&gt; The use of the elephant as a symbol of the [[Republican Party (United States)|U.S. Republican Party]] began with an [[Republican elephant|1874 cartoon]] by [[Thomas Nast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Year=2003&amp;Month=November&amp;Date=7 |title=Cartoon of the Day: "The Third-Term Panic" |publisher=HarpWeek |access-date=1 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921045800/http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Year=2003&amp;Month=November&amp;Date=7 |archive-date=21 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit community, such as "The Elephant's Child" from [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]'', [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Dumbo]],'' and Kathryn and Byron Jackson's ''The Saggy Baggy Elephant''. Other elephant heroes [[Anthropomorphism|given human qualities]] include [[Jean de Brunhoff]]'s [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], [[David McKee]]'s [[Elmer the Patchwork Elephant|Elmer]], and [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[Horton the Elephant|Horton]].&lt;ref name="Van Riper 73"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Van Riper |author2=A.

'''Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ᵻ|ˈ|k|æ|p|r|i|oʊ}}, {{IPA-it|diˈkaːprjo|lang}}; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, film producer, and [[environmentalist]]. He has often played unconventional roles, particularly in biopics and period films. {{As of|2019}}, his films have grossed $7.2&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide, and he has placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.

Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he played recurring roles in various television series, such as the sitcom ''[[Parenthood (1990 TV series)|Parenthood]]''. Leonardo DiCaprio had his first major film role as [[Tobias Wolff|Tobias "Toby" Wolff]] in ''[[This Boy's Life]]'' (1993). He received critical acclaim and first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]] nominations for his supporting role as a developmentally disabled boy Arnie Grape in ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'' (1993); at age 19, it made him the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Best Actor in a Supporting Role|seventh-youngest nominee]] in the category. He achieved international stardom in the epic romance ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), which became the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] to that point. After a few commercially unsuccessful films, DiCaprio starred in two successful features in 2002: the biographical crime drama ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' and the historical drama ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', which marked his first of [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|many collaborations]] with director [[Martin Scorsese]].

DiCaprio portrayed [[Howard Hughes]] in ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004) and continued to receive acclaim for his performances in the political thriller ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'' (2006), the crime drama ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006), and the romantic drama ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'' (2008). In the 2010s, he starred in the science fiction thriller ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), the western ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012), the biopic ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013), the survival drama ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015), and the comedy-drama ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]'' (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes. [[List of awards and nominations received by Leonardo DiCaprio|His accolades]] include an [[Academy Award]], a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for ''The Revenant'' as well as two other Golden Globes for ''The Aviator'' and ''The Wolf of Wall Street''.

DiCaprio is the founder of [[Appian Way Productions]]—a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series ''[[Greensburg (TV series)|Greensburg]]'' (2008–2010)—and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment. In 2005, he was named the commander of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he was named one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.

{{Michael Jordan series}}
'''Air Jordan''' (sometimes abbreviated '''''AJ''''') is an American brand of basketball shoes, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. Founded in [[Chicago]], Air Jordan was created for [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] basketball player and six-time [[NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] [[Michael Jordan]] during his time with the [[Chicago Bulls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History Of Air Jordan {{!}} Foot Locker |url=https://www.footlocker.com/history-of-air-jordan.html |website=www.footlocker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brinson |first1=Jonathon Berlin, Jemal R. |title=34 years of Air Jordans: A look at the sneaker institution that Michael Jordan and Nike built |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-cb-michael-jordan-air-jordan-shoes-timeline-20200422-scqnqnmomnhmxbxiahg55vurii-htmlstory.html |access-date=8 February 2021 |work=chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Jordan===
[[File:74892143 f94145facb.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Air Jordan I, (Royal Blue Colorway)]]
The first Air Jordan was produced for Michael Jordan during his time with the Chicago Bulls in 1984 and designed by Peter C. Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Still The One: Why the Remastered Chicago Jordan 1 Is a Must-Have |url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2015/05/why-the-chicago-jordan-1-matters |access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302104132/http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2015/05/why-the-chicago-jordan-1-matters|archive-date=March 2, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red and black colorway of the Nike Air Ship, the prototype for the Jordan I, was later outlawed by then-NBA Commissioner [[David Stern]] for having very little white on them (this rule, known as the "51 percent" rule, was repealed in the late 2000s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nike-celebrating-banned-air-jordans-with-new-release-174631314.html |title=The true story of the banned Air Jordans |website=Yahoo News |last=DePaula |first=Nick |date=July 21, 2016|access-date=December 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206162021/https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nike-celebrating-banned-air-jordans-with-new-release-174631314.html|archive-date=December 6, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solecollector.com/news/2016/07/the-true-story-behind-the-banned-air-jordan |title=The True Story Behind the Banned Air Jordan |access-date=November 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809025603/http://solecollector.com/news/2016/07/the-true-story-behind-the-banned-air-jordan|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nike Air Ship was banned, Michael Jordan and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] introduced the Jordan I in colorways with more white, such as the "Chicago" and "Black Toe" colorways. They used the Nike Air Ship's ban as a promotional tool in advertisements, hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage.
The Air Jordan I was originally released from 1985 to 1986, with re-releases (known as "retros") in 1994, 2001–2004, and 2007 to the present. Along with the introduction of the Retro Air Jordan line ups, the brand has elevated to a household notoriety with star-struck collaborations and unique limited releases.

===Air Jordan II===
[[File:Jordan II.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.86|Air Jordan II, (White/Red Colorway)]]
The success of the Air Jordan I encouraged Nike to release a new Air Jordan in 1986 for the new basketball season. Designed by Peter Moore and Bruce Kilgore, the Air Jordan II was unique in that it was [[made in Italy]]. In early tests, MJ actually wore a prototype that fused the upper of the original Air Jordan with the cushioning being designed for the new model. The Air Jordan II featured a full-length Air-Sole unit intended to cushion's MJ's sore feet. The shoe bore a similar silhouette to the Nike Air Python that would release the following year. The AJ II featured a faux lizard skin and swooping lines that resembled the detailing of a sports car. This design aesthetic would factor into the Air Jordan line later in the series. The AJ II introduced better cushioning with a polyurethane midsole and a full-length encapsulated Nike Air capsule for maximum comfort. The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh featured on the upper, though "Nike" was stitched across the heel counter. MJ only got to wear the Air Jordan II for 18 games in the 1986-87 season due to a broken foot. The shoe originally retailed at $100 when it was released from 1986 to 1987. The shoe later re-released, as the Jordan Retro 2, in 1994, 2004–05, 2008, 2010, 2014–18.

=== Air Jordan III ===
[[File:Air Jordan III.jpg|thumb|204x204px|AIr Jordan III ( Red Cement Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan III was designed in 1988 by [[Tinker Hatfield]], who works for Nike as a designer for stores and offices. By that time Michael Jordan was ready to leave Nike, but the Jordan III changed his mind. It was the first Air Jordan to feature a visible air unit on the heel, the new [[Jumpman (logo)|Jumpman logo]], an elephant print trim and tumbled leather to give it a luxury look. The Air Jordan III was also famous for the humorous ads depicting film director [[Spike Lee]] as [[Mars Blackmon]], the character he played in his film ''[[She's Gotta Have It]]''. This campaign was known as "Mars and Mike", which was one of Nike's most successful advertisement campaigns. These were the first Jordans to feature the "NIKE AIR" logo on the back. These were said to be Michael Jordan's favorite shoes, he wore them during the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest#1980's|1988 NBA Slam Dunk Contest]] and many other events in his basketball career. The Air Jordan III's had poor sales when first reintroduced in 1994. On their second reintroduction in 2001, they sold well.

In 2007, Jordan Brand collaborated with director [[Spike Lee]] to release a limited pair of Air Jordan IIIs with a colorway based on the blue-yellow poster for Lee's film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.

In 2009, the Jordan Brand reintroduced the highly sought after Air Jordan III in the True Blue colorway. It was an international-only release, meaning they were not sold in the US. In 2011, the brand released a Black History Month&amp;nbsp;(BHM) Air Jordan III colorway in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of Black History Month. Also, the same year saw the release of the "True Blue" III on June 4. The Stealth colorway of the III was released in September and the Black Cements were released in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sneakerfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/air-jordan-3-black-cement-retro.jpg |title=Air Jordan 3 Black Cement Retro|access-date=December 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916071219/http://www.sneakerfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/air-jordan-3-black-cement-retro.jpg|archive-date=September 16, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Black Flips" were released on December 3, 2011. In 2013, Jordan released a special edition of the Jordan III this shoe was deemed the Air Jordan III "Retro '88" White Cement and were released in February.

On February 15, 2020, the most recent version of the shoe Air Jordan 3 SE “Red Cement” was released in celebration of Chicago, Illinois hosting the 2020 Nba All-Star Game. The brand also debuted a Chicago-exclusive version of the colorway. This pair features “Nike Chi” branding on the heel, replacing the traditional “Nike Air” branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Briguglio |first1=Mario |title=Air Jordan 3 Red Cement CK5692-600 Release Date - Sneaker Bar Detroit |url=https://sneakerbardetroit.com/air-jordan-3-red-cement-ck5692-600-release-date/ |date=January 23, 2020 |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212220326/https://sneakerbardetroit.com/air-jordan-3-red-cement-ck5692-600-release-date/ |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiple retros and new colorways have been released in 1994, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2016–2020.

===Air Jordan IV===
[[File:Nike Air Jordan IV, (White Cement Colorway).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Air Jordan IV, (White Cement Colorway)]]
In 1989, Nike released the Air Jordan IV to the public. Designed by [[Tinker Hatfield]], it was the first Air Jordan released on the global market. It had four colorways: White/Black, Black/Cement Grey, White/Fire Red-Black, and Off White/Military Blue.

Nike featured director and actor Spike Lee in ads for the AJ IV. Lee had featured the shoe in his movie ''[[Do The Right Thing]]''.

Michael Jordan wore the Air Jordan IV when he made "[[The Shot]]," a series winner in Game 5 of the 1989 NBA First Round between the [[Chicago Bulls]] and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. In 2012 a Cavalier colorway dubbed the "Cavs" was released to honor "The Shot."

The Air Jordan IV re-released in 1999, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010–2013 and 2015–2020, most recently with the re-release of the, "Black Cat" colorway.

=== Air Jordan V ===
[[File:Nike Air Jordan V .jpg|upright=0.86|thumb|right|Air Jordan V, (Fire Red Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan V was released in February 1990, designed by [[Tinker Hatfield]] again. Some elements were carried over from the Air Jordan IV, but overall they were a completely new look. Some of its new features include a reflective tongue (with a unique protruding design and look), translucent rubber soles and lace locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cultedge.com/2018/01/air-jordan-5-history/ |title=Retro Vibes: Revisiting Air Jordan 5 Greatness • CultEdge.com |website=CultEdge.com |language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201020149/https://cultedge.com/2018/01/air-jordan-5-history/|archive-date=February 1, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soles gave them a new look, but yellowed over time when exposed to moisture and were the source of many complaints early on due to the slippery nature of the soles when collecting dust.

Hatfield is believed to have drawn inspiration for the Air Jordan V from World War II fighter planes, which was most notably visible in the shark teeth shapes on the midsole. The Air Jordan V was reintroduced in 2000, including a new colorway featuring Michael Jordan's high school (Laney High) colors. In 2006 several V's were reintroduced, including the LS "Grape" V's, the LS "Burgundy" V's, the "Fire-Red" V's, the "Green Bean" V's, and "Stealth Blue" V's. Along with the latter, a very limited laser design and the black/metallic/fire red colorways were released in early 2007.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2000, 2006–2009, 2011, and 2013–2017.

The Air Jordan V saw a lot of use in popular sitcom ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. During many episodes [[Will Smith]] wore the 'Metallic Silver', 'Grape', and 'Fire Red' colorway. To pay tribute to his character, Jordan released the Air Jordan 5 Bel Air in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kicksonfire.com/tag/air-jordan-5-bel-air/ |title=Air Jordan 5 Bel Air • KicksOnFire.com |website=KicksOnFire.com |language=en-US|access-date=September 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923034400/http://www.kicksonfire.com/tag/air-jordan-5-bel-air/|archive-date=September 23, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air Jordan VI ===
[[File:Air jordan VIs.jpg|thumb|Air Jordan VI – 2010 Retro (Black/Varsity Red Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan VI had a new design by Tinker Hatfield and released in 1991. The Original 5 colorways were: Black/Infrared, White/Infrared, White/Carmine-Black, White/Sport Blue, and Off White/Maroon. The Air Jordan VI introduced a reinforcement around the toe, It had two holes in the tongue, and a molded heel tab on the back of the sneaker (demanded by Jordan so it wouldn't hit his [[Achilles tendon]]). Like the Air Jordan V, this sneaker also had translucent rubber soles. The Air Jordan VI was the last Air Jordan to feature the Nike Air logo on it.

Later that year the [[Chicago Bulls|Bulls]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] in the [[1991 NBA Finals]], with Jordan (wearing the Black/Infrared) named as the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|most valuable player]]. That was also the first NBA Championship won by Jordan and the Bulls. The Jordan VI was also seen in the film ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'', which was produced in 1991 and released one year later.

The Air Jordan VI has been retro-ed many times since its original release in 1991, Notable releases were in 2000, 2010, 2014 and 2019 with the Black Infrared Colorway.

In addition to a Porsche-inspired rear pull tab and visible air the Air Jordan VI was the first Jordan with an inner bootie.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2008–2010, 2012, and 2014–2017 and 2019.

The VI was the first shoe used by the protagonist of ''[[Slam Dunk (manga)|Slam Dunk]]'', Hanamichi Sakuragi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jansbasketball.blogspot.com/2012/07/air-jordan-shoes-that-used-in-slam-dunk.html |title=Air Jordan Shoes That Used in The Slam Dunk Manga Series !!|access-date=December 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221045547/http://jansbasketball.blogspot.com/2012/07/air-jordan-shoes-that-used-in-slam-dunk.html|archive-date=December 21, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nike released special versions of both the VI and the Jordan Super.Fly 3 featuring artwork from the series in 2014. The VI also had Sakuragi's number 10 embroidered on the side of the heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2014/10/jordan-brand-slam-dunk-collection-official-images |title=Nike Officially Unveils the Jordan Brand "Slam Dunk" Collection |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |last=Marcelo |first=John |date=October 16, 2014|access-date=December 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220205717/http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2014/10/jordan-brand-slam-dunk-collection-official-images|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other models in the Air Jordan line are featured in the series, including the original (which Sakuragi eventually switched to), the V, and the XII (both worn by Sakuragi's rival, Kaede Rukawa).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2014/10/best-sneakers-slam-dunk-manga-anime-series/ |title=The Best Sneakers from the Slam Dunk Manga and Anime Series |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |last=So |first=Daniel |date=October 30, 2014|access-date=December 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220210229/http://www.complex.com/sneakers/2014/10/best-sneakers-slam-dunk-manga-anime-series/|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air Jordan VII ===
[[File:Air Jordan VII (Maillot N°9 de la Dream Team).JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Air Jordan VII sneakers specially released for [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]].]]
The Air Jordan VII was released in 1992 with a new design by Tinker Hatfield. This shoe introduced the huarache technology which allowed the shoes to better conform to the user's foot. A few things were no longer featured on the new model, such as the visible air sole, the Nike Air logo, and the translucent soles. This was the first Air Jordan in the line that did not have any distinctive "Nike Air" on the outer portions of the shoe. The "Nike Air" branding was still on the in-soles, which Air Jordans VIII–XI also had. The VIIs were also known for a successful ad campaign in which [[Bugs Bunny]] appeared alongside Michael Jordan to market the shoes.

When Jordan went to compete at the [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]] to play for the US Men's Basketball Team (also known as the "[[United States men's national basketball team#1992 Olympics (Barcelona) – The Dream Team|Dream Team]]"), Nike released a special Olympic color combo of the Air Jordan VII model which had Jordan's Olympic jersey number 9, instead of the usual "23" found on other colorways.

Various models of the Air Jordan VII were re-released in 2002, again in 2004, and again with different colors in 2006.

In 2011 the Air Jordan VII saw releases in the "Orion" and "Bordeaux" colorways. The "Olympic" and "Charcoal" (commonly referred to as Raptors) were re-released in 2012.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008–2012, and 2015–2017.

=== Air Jordan VIII ===
[[File:Air Jordan VIII, (Playoffs Colorway).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Air Jordan VIII, (Playoffs Colorway)]]
The Air Jordan VIII was released to coincide with the [[1992–93 NBA season|1992–1993 NBA season]]. The eighth model of the Air Jordan was noticeably heavier than its predecessors. The Air Jordan VIII model became known as the "Punisher" because of the advanced basketball ankle support and enhanced traction. This shoe contains a full length air sole, [[polyurethane]] midsole, [[polycarbonate]] shank plate, and two crossover straps (for added support and more custom fit).

The shoe was retro-ed in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2013, and 2015–2017.

=== Air Jordan IX ===
[[File:Nike Air Jordan IX.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Air Jordan IX, (Bulls Colorway)]]
Originally released in November 1993, the Air Jordan IX model was the first model released after Michael Jordan's retirement. Jordan never played an NBA season wearing these shoes. This model was inspired by baseball cleats that Jordan wore when playing minor-league baseball.

Like the VII and VIII models, the Air Jordan IX featured an inner sock sleeve and [[nubuck]] accents. The sole featured different symbols and languages of different countries. The Air Jordan IX has been the shoe chosen to adorn Jordan's feet for his statue outside of the [[United Center]] in [[Chicago]].

In popular culture, the children's movie ''[[The Little Rascals (film)|The Little Rascals]]'' depicted one of the bullies, Butch, wearing a pair of these shoes. American rap icon [[Tupac Shakur]] also wore Air Jordans in a popular "Thug Life" photo in 1993.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2002, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014–2018.

=== Air Jordan X ===
[[File:Nike Air Jordan X Steel.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Air Jordan X, (Steel Colorway)]]
This was released in 1994 in three colorways - White/Black/Light Steel Grey 'Steel Grey,' White/Black/Dark Powder Blue 'Powder Blue,' Black/Dark Shadow/True Red 'Shadow.' More followed: Powder Blue (worn by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]'s [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|Men]]'s and [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|Women]]'s basketball teams), [[Orlando Magic]]*, [[New York Knicks]]*, [[Seattle SuperSonics]]*, and [[Sacramento Kings]]*. It was the first ''Air Jordan'' to feature a lightweight Phylon midsole. The shoe also featured all of Michael Jordan's accomplishments up to his first retirement on the outsole.

In 2012, the Air Jordan X was re-released. They are dubbed the "Chicago Bulls", as they are part of a regional pack (City Pack), representing five teams. The lacing and tongue are completely black, and the red inner lining contrasts with the red inserts on the outsole. The outsole's design features a striped (wavy) design, which list many of Jordan's accomplishments. They retailed at $160. The Air Jordan X was released again in an OVO collaboration in 2015 and 2016, releasing in white and black colorways respectively with stingray detailing.

The shoe was retro-ed in 2005, 2008, 2012–2016, and 2018.

=== Air Jordan XI ===
[[File:Air Jordan XI.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Air Jordan XI, (Bred Colorway)]]
This model was designed by Tinker Hatfield. When the shoe launched, Michael Jordan (retired from basketball by then) was with the [[Birmingham Barons]] in baseball's minor baseball leagues. Hatfield designed the sneaker waiting for Jordan to come back and hoping he would play in them.

The ballistic mesh upper of the sneaker was meant to make the Air Jordan XI lighter and more durable than past sneakers. Further changes came with the use of a carbon fiber spring plate in the translucent "frosty" outsole, giving the shoe better torque when twisting on the court. The highlight and arguably best-known aspect of the shoe is its patent leather mudguard. Patent leather was lightweight compared to genuine leather and also tended not to stretch as much – a property to help keep the foot within the bounds of the foot bed during directional changes on the court. The patent leather gave the XI a "formal" look. When this shoe released, some wore this model with business suits instead of dress shoes.

The sneakers were only samples in 1995 when Jordan decided to come back to the NBA. Hatfield and Nike discouraged Jordan from playing in them, but once they were produced, he couldn't resist. Also noteworthy, Jordan violated league dress code by wearing the shoes, as his teammates wore all-black shoes. It wasn't the first time Jordan had run afoul of NBA footwear rules, having broken them with his very first signature shoe in 1985. He was fined $5,000 for not following the Bulls' colorway policy with the AJ XI. After the fine, Nike made him a pair of the shoes in a black/white/concord colorway for the series against Orlando; Jordan wore [[Penny Hardaway]]'s signature black Nike Air Flight shoes for Game 3 while said colorway was under production. A similar black/white/royal blue colorway was released to the public at the end of 2000. The colorway was changed for the public release because the concord purple had looked like royal blue on television.

Jordan wore the Air Jordan XI on the way to helping the Chicago Bulls claim the [[1995–96 NBA season|1995–96 NBA Championship]]. He also wore the XI white Columbia colorway in the [[1996 NBA All-Star Game]] and was selected [[NBA All-Star Game MVP|MVP]] of the game. The shoes received more media exposure when Jordan wore the Air Jordan XI model in the 1996 animated movie ''[[Space Jam]]''. These shoes were eventually released in 2000 and re-released in 2009 with the nickname "Space Jams." The concord purple was changed to royal blue for the released versions of the shoe.

The Air Jordan XI was originally released from 1995 to 1996. It was retro'd in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006–2018 and 2019. The Air Jordan XI is the most popular Air Jordan in the series and has released almost ritualistically every December since 2008, selling out in minutes. It also is Hatfield's favorite.

[[File:Air Jordan XII Playoffs.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Air Jordan XII, (Playoffs Colorway)]]
The ''Air Jordan XII'' was inspired by [[Flag of Japan|Nisshoki]] (the Japanese flag), and a 19th-century women dress boot. However, featuring gold-plated steel lace loops, embossed lizard skin pattern and a full length zoom air unit with a carbon fiber shank plate, this model set a new direction in style and technology in shoe design. Though not as light weight as previous models, the construction and firmness of the shoe is widely considered to be the most durable and sturdy shoes from the Air Jordan line. The first model released after the creation of subsidiary Jordan Brand, the Air Jordan XII has no Nike branding on it of any kind, while all the models before it have Nike Air or other Nike branding outwardly (Air Jordans I-VI) or just simply on the insoles (Air Jordans VII–XI). This shoe came in 5 colorways and was released on March 13. The shoe was re-released on December 25, 2008 with the Eleven as the final countdown pack. In addition, the Twelve was combined with the Thirteen numbered Jordan to produce the 12.5. As of today, the 11/12 countdown package (retro) retails for {{dollarsign|USD|750|lk=on}}–{{dollarsign|USD|800|lk=off}}, well above the starting price of {{dollarsign|USD|310|lk=off}}. The Air Jordan XII has been subject to many highly limited colorways recently such as the Air Jordan 12 x PSNY collaboration, the Wings colorway that was limited to 12,000 pairs, and the OVO collaboration.

They were re-released in 2005, which coincided with the release of the Air Jordan 8s shoe.

In the movie ''[[He Got Game]]'', the Air Jordan XIII was worn by Jake Shuttlesworth ([[Denzel Washington]]).

The Air Jordan XVs were released in 1999–2000. [[Reggie Miller]] wore it during the [[2000 NBA Finals]].

This was the first shoe after Jordan's retirement. The design of the XV's originated from the aircraft prototype X-15, which was developed by [[NASA]] during the 1950s. The sides of the XV were made from woven kevlar fiber. The Jordan XVs were the first Air Jordans to be negatively received in a while (the last being the Air Jordan 2s), because the quality on the Jordan shoes was bad.&lt;ref name="air-jordans.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air-jordans.com/# |title=Nike Store.

Air Jordan XVIs, designed by Nike's Senior Footwear Designer Wilson Smith, were released in 2001. This meaning it was the first design since the II's that Hatfield was not behind. Smith decided to bring in a few design elements/fabrics from earlier releases. The shoe featured the return of the clear rubber sole (V, VI, XI) and patent leather (XI).

Unique to the Air Jordan XVI was a gaiter/shroud that covered the shoe and could be removed to give the shoe a new look. Not only was this for fashion purposes, it also had a thermal functionality.

The shoe was said to be stiff and that the shroud/gaiter could easily fall off when playing basketball. The black/red and white/midnight navy versions of the shoe both featured patent leather which very easily creased and cracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.air-jordans.com/content/frame.html |title=Nike Store.

=== Air Jordan XIX ===

Three regional colorways and three special edition colorways were released. They consisted of the East, West, and Midwest edition for regular and West, East, and Olympic for the SE (special edition).

The Air Jordan XIX used innovative materials. The upper section of shoe was developed in collaboration with the global materials consultancy [[Material ConneXion]], who sourced Nike a sleeving normally used in architectural applications for protecting [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipes from bursting. In theory, this allowed for a shoe without laces, because the sleeving does not stretch. Nonetheless, the Air Jordan XIX model did include a set of laces behind the sleeve to better secure the shoe. They are the lightest Air Jordans ever made.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The shoes appeared on the sitcom [[My Wife And Kids]], in the episode "Fantasy Camp: Part 2", when the protagonist Michael Kyle ([[Damon Wayans]]) steals it from Jordan's hotel room and uses it to play against Jordan himself later in the episode.

====Retro 6 Infrared Pack====
The Jordan 6 white/infrared and black/infrared was released February 14, 2013, at a retail price of {{dollarsign|USD|170|lk=off}}. This is the second of the same colorway retro in Jordan Brand history. The first time retro on both colorways were in 2000, they were retro separately. This time, the retro distinguished with the previous release. The heel logo are using Jumpman logo instead of Nike Air logo, this is the most significant difference between these two re-releases. Jordan Brand started using Jumpman logo

Air Jordan Brand released 5 new colorways including one that is themed after another Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing."

There will be more colors of the Air Jordan Spizikes released than of the recent Air Jordan 3 retro re-release. The Air Jordan "Spiz'ikes" take pieces from the following Air Jordans:
* Air Jordan 3 – sole, midsole, and "Spike"/elephant print
* Air Jordan 4 – "wings" on the sides of the shoes that hold lace loops to place.

==="Air Jordan Sixty Plus"===
The first Jordan Sixty Plus was released in August 2009. The Jordan 6ixty Plus (60+) is a hybrid sneaker from Jordan Brand that combines the various sneakers Michael Jordan wore when he scored 60 or more points in an NBA Game. In these games, MJ was wearing the Jordan I, II, V and VII. Inspiration came from the Air Jordan 5 because he was wearing those when he scored his career high of 69 points.
* Air Jordan 1 – Toebox shape and perforations
* Air Jordan 2 – Snakeskin accents, rear TPU, lower Eyelets, Jordan "Wings" logo on tongue
* Air Jordan 5 – Midsole/Outsole, shape of tongue, Lacelock, mold of upper near ankle, higher eyelets, "Air Jordan" tag inside of tongue
* Air Jordan 7 – Perforations on side panel, "gap" between ankle area and body of shoe, graphics on tongue, heel tab, 23 on rear TPU

==="Jordan Son of Mars edition"===
The "Jordan Son of Mars" is an Air Jordan hybrid shoe, that released in the Summer of 2012. It borrows prominent design elements from the Air Jordan III, IV, V, VI, and XX.
It also retains a strap across the shoe laces, that is a custom modification with a design that seems to be elephant print but is instead a series of relevant icons, etc.
The Jordan Son of Mars was birthed from the [[Spizike]], which was originally inspired by all the Jordan shoes made in collaboration with famous urban director [[Spike Lee]]. Son of Mars is a sneaker directly influenced by Spike Lee's longtime involvement with the brand, as the shoe pieces together models in which Spike (or [[Mars Blackmon]] rather) had a hand in launching.

The shoe breakdown begins with elements from the first [[Tinker Hatfield]] years, Mars Blackmon; Lee's loudmouthed character first appeared alongside Michael Jordan for the release of the Air Jordan III, a sneaker whose immediately recognizable elephant print bookends the Jordan Son of Mars, with sectioning on the back end and towards the toe. Next the Air Jordan IV, which is pretty conspicuous in this hybrid release, shows up only in the form of the netting running below the laces. The sole construction is all Air Jordan V, as the coveted icy treatment splashes across the bottom and the angular 'teeth' of the midsole rear up towards the toe. The V actually extends its reach to the top end too, with the textured Jumpman tongue bursting out from the familiar see-through lacelocks. Building up the ankle area is the higher-hitting support of the Air Jordan VI, complete with the attached loop on back and the perforated paneling reaching up the side of the shoe. The midsection which completes the sneaker is a major fast-forward, leaping ahead to the Air Jordan XX in the form of the lasered strap.

The Jordan Son of Mars takes on one of the favorite color schemes in the Jordan Brand line.

===Jordan "6 Rings" shoe===
[[File:Air Jordan 6ix rings olympic dream and black red.jpg|thumb|Air Jordan "6 rings" in two colorways]]
The Jordan 6 Rings (aka Jordan Six Rings, Or Montells) is a combination of the seven Air Jordan shoes that Michael Jordan wore during his 6 Championship seasons. That includes the Air Jordan 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 14. The Jordan Brand company released the "6 Rings" shoes starting in September 2008.

The Jordan Brand released colorways representative of each team that the Chicago Bulls defeated in each of their six championship seasons during the 1990s. The colorways include colors borrowed from the following teams: the L.A. Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers, Phoenix Suns, the former Seattle SuperSonics, and Utah Jazz, each shoe of which includes laser-etched graphics detailing specific aspects about that particular championship series, the city of the competing team and so forth. Many other colorways exist and Jordan Brand continues to release additional colors that pay tribute to different Jordan and Nike shoes along with new colorways specific to 6 Rings shoes.

There even exists a "winterized 6 rings" which are a modified 6 Rings shoe turned into a durable boot designed for the outdoors which changes some of the design and placement of the inspired pieces and parts from the Air Jordans the shoe pays tribute.

Of particular note, there is an Olympic colorway, a Nelly version apparently inspired by the rap artist [[Nelly]] and a shoe that combines the colors of all the teams that the Bulls defeated in the NBA Finals, acting as the 'sixth shoe' since only five separate teams were defeated for the Bulls to win six championships; the Utah Jazz was defeated twice, in 1997 and 1998.

===Manufacturing===
[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] owns none of the factories where Air Jordans are produced and contracts the work to various factory owners. Company officials say that they only design and market the shoes. However, Nike dictates production terms and standards to the contractor, often without questioning labor or safety practices. In April 1997, 10,000 Indonesian workers went on strike over wage violations at an Air Jordan factory. The same month in Vietnam 1,300 workers went on strike demanding a 1-cent-per-hour raise, and a year later in 1998, 3,000 workers in China went on strike to protest hazardous working conditions and low wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalexchange.org/sweatfree/nike/faq |title=Nike FAQs - Global Exchange |access-date=November 8, 2016|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026223516/http://www.globalexchange.org/sweatfree/nike/faq |archive-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Space Jam'' ===
On January 26, 1992, Jordan Brand debuted a [[Super Bowl commercial|commercial]] during [[Super Bowl XXVI]] which showed [[Bugs Bunny]] enlisting the help of Michael Jordan to outsmart a bullying rival team using cartoon gags. A second ad premiered in 1993 featuring Bugs and Jordan facing off against [[Marvin the Martian]]. The ads inspired Jordan's agent, [[David Falk]], to pitch a film starring Jordan and the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' characters. The pitch resulted in ''[[Space Jam]]'', a commercial success which grossed over $230 million at the box office and generated over $1 billion in merchandise sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Francisco |first1=Eric |title=The Nike Ad That Inspired 'Space Jam' Was Nostalgic Paydirt |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/23641-space-jam-nike-jordan-nostalgia-bugs-bunny |website=Inverse |access-date=4 September 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116115725/https://www.inverse.com/article/23641-space-jam-nike-jordan-nostalgia-bugs-bunny |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jones |first1=Nate |title=Why Did Michael Jordan Star in 'Space Jam'? |url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/why-michael-jordan-did-space-jam.html |website=Vulture |publisher=Vox Media, LLC |access-date=4 September 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116115800/https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/why-michael-jordan-did-space-jam.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the advertising campaign and the film contributed to the popularity of ''Looney Tunes'' and other cartoon characters as motifs in street fashion through the 1990s and 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Josephs |first1=Brian |title=Lord Forgive Me: The Life of Urban Looney Tunes |url=https://www.gq.com/story/life-of-urban-looney-tunes |website=GQ |publisher=Condé Nast |access-date=4 September 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116115741/https://www.gq.com/story/life-of-urban-looney-tunes |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; spawned limited editions of Air Jordan sneakers in colorways paying homage to such characters as Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian, and [[Lola Bunny]], popularized the Air Jordan XI as worn by Jordan in the film, and led to the development of a sequel, entitled ''[[Space Jam: A New Legacy]]'' and starring [[LeBron James]], to be released in 2021.

==Career==
===1980s: Early film and theater roles===
Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a [[spear carrier]] in a [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] performance of ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spacey|first=Kevin|url=http://www.kevinspacey.com/theatre/item/henry-iv-part-one/|title=Henry IV Part One|website=www.kevinspacey.com|access-date=October 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103185058/http://www.kevinspacey.com/theatre/item/henry-iv-part-one/|archive-date=November 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he made his first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] appearance, as Oswald in a production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', starring [[Liv Ullmann]]. Then he portrayed Philinte in [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Misanthrope]]''. In 1984, Spacey appeared in a production of [[David Rabe]]'s ''[[Hurlyburly]]'', in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the [[Hurlyburly (film)|film version]]). Next came [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' alongside [[David Strathairn]] and [[Colleen Dewhurst]]. In 1986, Spacey appeared in a production of ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' in a [[New Jersey]] dinner theatre.&lt;ref name="cornucopia"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Pat |last=Cerasaro|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/FLASH-FRIDAY-A-Kevin-Spacey-Cornucopia-Stage-Big-Screen-Small-Screen-NOW-20140502 |title=Flash Friday: A Kevin Spacey Cornucopia — Stage, Big Screen, Small Screen &amp; Now |magazine=Broadway World |publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|location=New York City|date=May 2, 2014 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacey's prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Peter Gallagher]] and [[Bethel Leslie]] as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in [[Jonathan Miller]]'s lauded production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]''. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to Spacey&lt;ref name="parade"&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Brady|url=https://www.kevinspacey.com/press/item/parade/|title=In Step With: Kevin Spacey|magazine=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=Athlon Media Group|location=Nashville, Tennessee|via=kevinspacey.com|date=December 5, 2004|access-date=February 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103185934/http://www.kevinspacey.com/press/item/parade/|archive-date=November 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | first = Michael |last = Buckley| url = http://www.playbill.com/article/stage-to-screens-kevin-spacey-talks-about-his-new-film-and-his-idols-com-163095| title=Stage to Screens: Kevin Spacey Talks About His New Film, and His Idols |magazine=[[Playbill]] |publisher = Playbill Inc.| location=New York City|date= July 27, 2009 |access-date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'', playing a [[Kennedy family|Kennedy-esque]] American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a [[Tony Award]] for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in [[Neil Simon]]'s Broadway hit ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]''. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Also in 1986, Spacey made his first film appearance in [[Mike Nichols]]' ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' starring [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Jack Nicholson]]. Spacey plays a small role credited as a subway thief. In 1988 Spacey also briefly appeared in another Nichols' film ''[[Working Girl]]'', as sleazy businessman Bob Speck. Some of Spacey's other early roles include a widowed, eccentric millionaire on ''[[L.A. Law]]''; the television miniseries ''[[The Murder of Mary Phagan]]'' (1988), opposite Lemmon; and the comedy ''[[See No Evil, Hear No Evil]]'' (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series ''[[Wiseguy]]''.

===1990s: Rise to stardom ===
Spacey quickly developed a reputation as a [[character actor]], and was cast in bigger roles, including the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992), one-half of a bickering [[Connecticut]] couple in the [[dark comedy]] film ''[[The Ref]]'' (1994), and a malicious [[Hollywood]] studio boss in the satire ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1995), gaining him positive notices by critics. Spacey's performance as the enigmatic criminal [[Keyser Söze|Verbal Kint]] in [[Bryan Singer]]'s 1995 [[neo-noir]] film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' won him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].&lt;ref name=tca&gt;{{cite episode |title=Kevin Spacey |series=Inside the Actors Studio |date=July 2, 2000 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26GE33raQNQ |network=Bravo |season=6 |number=10|last=Lipton |first=James (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Spacey also appeared in the [[David Fincher]]'s detective thriller ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', making a sudden entrance late in the film as the [[serial killer]] John Doe after going uncredited and unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in ''Seven'', ''The Usual Suspects'' and ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'' earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 [[Society of Texas Film Critics Awards 1995|Society of Texas Film Critics Awards]].&lt;ref name="aas951230"&gt;{{cite news |first=Abraham |last=Levy |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAD97C511DD8C8F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D | title=Texas film critics give 'Suspects' top honors |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|publisher=[[Cox Media Group]]|location=Austin, Texas|date=December 30, 1995 |access-date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ac960105"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A530347 |title=The Society of Texas Film Critics 1995 Awards |work=[[Austin Chronicle]] | publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|location=Austin, Texas|date=January 5, 1996|access-date=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey played an egomaniacal [[district attorney]] in ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'' (1996), and founded [[Trigger Street Productions]] in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. Spacey made his directorial debut with the film ''[[Albino Alligator]]'' (1996). The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $339,379 with a budget of $6&amp;nbsp;million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="cornucopia" /&gt;

Throughout his career, Spacey has been well known for playing villains; he remarked in 2013: "I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Chris | last = Nashawaty| title=Kevin Spacey: Good 'n' Evil |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Spacey acted alongside [[Annette Bening]] in [[Sam Mendes]]' ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''. In the film he played the role of Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father and advertising executive who lusts after his teenage daughter's best friend. Spacey won his second [[Academy Award|Oscar]] this time for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]]. In his acceptance speech he dedicated his Oscar to [[Jack Lemmon]] praising him as an influence, mentor, and father figure. He also stated, "[Lemmon's] performance in ''[[The Apartment]]'' stands as one of the finest we've ever had".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCjt7PME5_E|title= Kevin Spacey Wins Best Actor: 2000 Oscars|website= [[YouTube]]|access-date= May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/072-1/|title= Kevin Spacey Academy Awards Acceptance Speech|website= Oscars.org|date=May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Spacey won the [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor]] and earned another [[Tony Award]] nomination in 1999 for ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.playbill.com/article/1999-tony-nominee-kevin-spacey-leading-actor-play-the-iceman-cometh-com-82301|title= 1999 Tony Nominee: Kevin Spacey (Leading Actor, Play, The Iceman Cometh)|website= [[Playbill]].com|access-date= May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s: Continued success ===
Spacey played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in ''[[Pay It Forward (film)|Pay It Forward]]'' (2000), a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in ''[[K-PAX (film)|K-Pax]]'' (2001), and singer [[Bobby Darin]] in ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004). The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin's life, career and relationship with actress [[Sandra Dee]]. Facing little interest for backing in the U.S., Spacey went to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] for funding. Almost all of the film was made in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="parade" /&gt; Spacey provided his own vocals on the film's soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of its release. Spacey received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jay | last=Boyar |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2004-12-29/news/0412280338_1_kevin-spacey-bobby-darin-pop-singer |title=A bit of Darin lives in Spacey |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |publisher=Orlando Sentinel Media Group|location=Orlando, Florida| date=December 29, 2004 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kevin Spacey @ San Diego Comic-Con 2008 - b.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Spacey at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2008]]
Spacey hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' twice: first in 1997 with musical guest [[Beck]] and special guests [[Michael Palin]] and [[John Cleese]] from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', and again in May 2006 with musical guest [[Nelly Furtado]]. In 2006, Spacey played [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Bryan Singer]] [[superhero]] film ''[[Superman Returns]]''. He was to return for its 2009 sequel, but the series was instead rebooted with the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ali|last=Plumb |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/kevin-spacey-jesse-eisenberg-playing-lex-luthor/ |title=Kevin Spacey on Jesse Eisenberg Playing Lex Luthor |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey also appeared in ''[[Edison (film)|Edison]]'', which received a [[direct-to-video]] release in 2006.

In 2008, Spacey played an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] lecturer in the film ''[[21 (2008 film)|21]]''. The film is based on [[Ben Mezrich]]'s best seller ''[[Bringing Down the House (book)|Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions]]'', a story of student MIT [[card-counting|card-counters]] who used [[mathematical probability]] to aid them in card games such as [[blackjack]]. In early 2010, Spacey went to [[China]] to star in writer-director [[Dayyan Eng]]'s [[black comedy]] film ''[[Inseparable (film)|Inseparable]]'', becoming the first Hollywood actor to star in a fully Chinese-funded film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = S.T.| last = Vanairsdale |url=http://movieline.com/2012/05/03/kevin-spaceys-chinese-buddy-superhero-movie-inseparable-looks-interesting/ |title=Kevin Spacey's Chinese Buddy-Superhero Movie Inseparable Looks...

And I have never in my twelve years ever gotten involved in politics in Great Britain.

The honor, [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]], was given at [[Clarence House]] by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]].

Spacey is well known in Hollywood for his [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressions]].

===Artistic director of the Old Vic===
[[File:Kevin Spacey (Berlin Film Festival 2011).jpg|thumb|Spacey at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]] 2011]]
In February 2003, Spacey announced that he was returning to [[London]] to become the artistic director of the [[Old Vic]], one of the city's oldest theatres.&lt;ref name="bbc20030203"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacey 'to run Old Vic' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2723437.stm | work = [[BBC News]] |date=February 3, 2003 |access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing at a press conference with [[Judi Dench]] and [[Elton John]], Spacey promised both to appear on stage and to bring in big-name talent.&lt;ref name="bbc20030206"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacey becomes London theatre boss | work = [[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2727845.stm |date=February 6, 2003 |access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook to remain in the post for a full ten years. The Old Vic Theatre Company staged shows eight months out of the year. Spacey's first season started in September 2004, and opened with the British premiere of the play ''[[Cloaca (film)|Cloaca]]'' by [[Maria Goos]], directed by Spacey, which opened to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="firstseason"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Old Vic |publisher=Old Vic Theatre |url=http://www.oldvictheatre.com/history.php |year=2008 |access-date=June 2, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516082930/http://www.oldvictheatre.com/history.php |archive-date=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 season, Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut, to good notices, in the [[Richard II of England|title role]] of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' directed by [[Trevor Nunn]].&lt;ref name="firstseason" /&gt;

While serving as artistic director, Spacey was photographed with [[Ghislaine Maxwell]] sitting in the throne room of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] during a private tour of [[Buckingham Palace]]. In 2020, Maxwell would be arrested and held without bail on [[Sex trafficking|child sex-trafficking charges]]. Former US President [[Bill Clinton]] was also in attendance, at the invitation of [[Prince Andrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Ghislaine Maxwell once sat on Buckingham Palace thrones with Kevin Spacey |publisher=Old Vic Theatre |url=https://nypost.com/2020/07/04/ghislaine-maxwell-kevin-spacey-once-sat-on-buckingham-palace-thrones/ |year=2020 |access-date=July 18, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2006, Spacey said that he was having the time of his life working at the Old Vic; at that point in his career, he said, he was "trying to do things now that are much bigger and outside [myself]".&lt;ref name="nyt-oldvic"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Lyall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/theater/29spac.html| title=Beyond a Sea of Criticism, All's Well for Kevin Spacey at Old Vic |newspaper=[[The New York Times|New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Media Company|date=May 29, 2006 |access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey performed in productions of ''National Anthems'' by Dennis McIntyre, and ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' by [[Philip Barry]], in which he played C.K. Dexter Haven, the [[Cary Grant]] role in the [[The Philadelphia Story (film)|film version]]. Critics applauded Spacey for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop.&lt;ref name="richardiii"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gazelle |last=Emami|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/10/kevin-spacey-richard-iii_n_1196493.html |title=Kevin Spacey As Richard III: BAM Production Of Sam Mendes Play Begins Its Run |work=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|location=New York City|date=October 1, 2012 |access-date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 season, Spacey suffered a major setback with a production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Resurrection Blues]]'', directed by [[Robert Altman]].&lt;ref name="bbc20060413"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spacey defends Old Vic management |work=[[BBC News]] |date=April 13, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4905638.stm |access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an all-star cast (including [[Matthew Modine]] and future ''House of Cards'' co-star [[Neve Campbell]]) and the pedigree of Miller's script, Spacey's decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed after only a few weeks.&lt;ref name="nyt-oldvic" /&gt; Later in the year, Spacey starred in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'', along with [[Colm Meaney]] and [[Eve Best]]. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007. For the spring part of the 2007–08 season, [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Laura Michelle Kelly]] joined Spacey as the three characters in [[David Mamet]]'s 1988 play ''[[Speed-the-Plow]]''.&lt;ref name="stage20071210"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alistair |last=Page |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/19128/goldblum-to-join-spacey-in-the-old-vics|title=Goldblum to join Spacey in the Old Vic's Speed-the-Plow |work=[[The Stage]] | publisher=The Stage Media Company Limited| location=London, England| date=December 10, 2007 |access-date=June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he directed the premiere of [[Joe Sutton]]'s ''[[Complicit (play)|Complicit]]'', with [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[David Suchet]] and [[Elizabeth McGovern]].&lt;ref name="richardiii" /&gt; Later that year, Trevor Nunn directed Spacey in a revival of ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]''.

==Personal life==
An article in ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'' in 1999 stated that Spacey's "love affair with acting, and the absence of a visible partner in the life of an attractive 40-year-old, has resulted in [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine asserting two years ago that he must be [[homosexuality|gay]]".&lt;ref name="Personal"&gt;{{cite news|first=Lesley |last=White |title=Spacey's Odyssey |url=https://drivingmrspacey.com/sunday-times-mag-1999/ |work=[[The Sunday Times Magazine]] |location=London, England|date=December 19, 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030557/https://drivingmrspacey.com/sunday-times-mag-1999/ |archive-date=November 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey responded to the rumors by telling ''[[Playboy]]'' and other interviewers that he was not gay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=October 1999 |url=http://www.kevinspacey.de/Presse/Playboy_englisch/playboy_englisch.html |title=Playboy interview | url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053756/http://www.kevinspacey.de/Presse/Playboy_englisch/playboy_englisch.html | via = kevinspacey.de | archive-date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and telling Lesley White of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;I chose for a long time not to answer these questions because of the manner in which they were asked, and because I was never talking to someone I trusted, so why should I? Recently I chose to participate because it's a little hard on the people I love.&lt;ref name="Personal" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1999, reports suggested Spacey was dating a [[script supervisor]] named Dianne Dreyer, with their relationship possibly dating back as far as 1992.&lt;ref name="Gotham"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sara |last=Bliss |title=The Drama King |url=http://kspacey.egloos.com/25064 |work=[[Gotham (magazine)|Gotham Magazine]] |publisher=Niche Media LLC|location=New York City| date=May 2007 |access-date=November 17, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Wolk |title=The Parties |url= https://ew.com/article/2000/04/07/post-oscar-parties/ |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City| date=April 7, 2000 | access-date = January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The days before the Oscars |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313173,00.html |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=April 7, 2000 | access-date = January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Spacey brought Dreyer to the [[Academy Awards]];&lt;ref name="Gotham" /&gt; during the acceptance speech for his Best Actor award, Spacey stated, "Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you."&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (presenter), Kevin Spacey (recipient) | date= January 4, 2010 |access-date= October 31, 2017 | title= Kevin Spacey Wins Best Actor: 2000 Oscars | medium= Video | publisher= [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCjt7PME5_E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Gotham (magazine)|Gotham]]'' magazine quoted Spacey saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;I've never believed in pimping my personal life out for publicity. Although I might be interested in doing it, I will never do it. People can gossip all they want; they can speculate all they want. I just happened to believe that there's a separation between the public life and the private life.

====Reaction and ramifications====
Amid the allegations, filming was suspended on the sixth and final season of ''House of Cards''. The show's production company had implemented "an anonymous complaint hotline, crisis counsellors, and sexual harassment legal advisors for the crew," and in 2012 stated, "someone on the crew shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey.

====Christmas Eve YouTube videos====
Beginning in 2018, Spacey has posted one new video to his [[YouTube]] channel on Christmas Eve. On December 24, 2018, Spacey uploaded a video titled "Let Me Be Frank," in which he – while in character as Frank Underwood – appeared to deny the real-life allegations leveled against him. The video was described as "bizarre," "stomach-churning," and "creepy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Politi|url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/12/kevin-spacey-releases-bizarre-stomach-churning-video-as-authorities-unveil-sexual-assault-charge.html|title=Kevin Spacey Releases Bizarre, Stomach-Churning Video as Authorities Unveil Sexual Assault Charge|website=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=December 25, 2018|access-date=December 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cydney|last=Henderson|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/12/25/patricia-arquette-rob-lowe-react-kevin-spacey-weird-video/2411652002/|title=Alyssa Milano, Ellen Barkin, more react to Kevin Spacey's 'creepy' Frank Underwood video|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=December 25, 2018|access-date=January 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2020, the video has over 12&amp;nbsp;million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let Me Be Frank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZveA-NAIDI|language=en|access-date=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/12/kevin-spaceys-let-me-be-frank-video-meaning/579034/|title=The Disturbing Truth About Kevin Spacey's 'Let Me Be Frank' Video|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|date=December 27, 2018|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Emerson Collective]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Delta Air Lines}}

===Early history===
Delta Air Lines' history begins with the world's first aerial crop dusting operation called [[Huff Daland Dusters]], Inc. The company was founded on March 2, 1925, in [[Macon, Georgia]] before moving to [[Monroe, Louisiana]] in summer 1925.&lt;ref name="Founding"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/founding|title=Founding|website=www.deltamuseum.org|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001235928/https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/founding|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the [[boll weevil]] infestation of cotton crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/aircraft-by-type/crop-duster/Huff-Daland-Duster|title=Huff Daland Duster, 1925-ca.1948|website=www.deltamuseum.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002171508/http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/aircraft-by-type/crop-duster/Huff-Daland-Duster|archive-date=October 2, 2019|access-date=October 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collett E. Woolman|C.E. Woolman]], general manager and later Delta's first CEO, led a group of local investors to acquire the company's assets. Delta Air Service was incorporated on December 3, 1928, and named after the [[Mississippi Delta]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Delta: The History of an Airline|last=Lewis and Newton|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1979|location=Athens, Ga.|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/leaders|title=C.E.

Passenger operations began on June 17, 1929,&lt;ref name=NAAH&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norwood |first1=Tom |last2=Wegg |first2=John |title=North American Airlines Handbook |publisher=Airways International |location=Sandpoint, Idaho |year=2002 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-9653993-8-9 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], with stops at [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], [[Louisiana]].

Local banker Travis Oliver, acting as a trustee, C.E. Woolman, and other local investors purchased back the crop-dusting assets of Delta Air Service and incorporated as Delta Air Corporation on December 31, 1930.

Delta Air Corporation secured an air mail contract in 1934, and began doing business as Delta Air Lines over Mail Route 24, stretching from Fort Worth, Texas, to Charleston, South Carolina.&lt;ref name="First Flights"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Delta: The History of an Airline|last=Lewis and Newton|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1979|location=Athens, Ga.|pages=28–29, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Founding"/&gt; Delta moved its headquarters from [[Monroe, Louisiana]], to its current location in [[Atlanta]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deltamuseum.org/docs/site/brochure/headquarters_booklet_2019edits.pdf?sfvrsn=2db8be21_2|title=Historic Aerospace Site: Delta Air Lines Headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia|work=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001235958/http://www.deltamuseum.org/docs/site/brochure/headquarters_booklet_2019edits.pdf?sfvrsn=2db8be21_2|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company name officially became Delta Air Lines in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1940|title=1940s|website=www.deltamuseum.org|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191001235925/https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1940|archive-date=October 1, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the company commenced regularly scheduled [[freight transport]]. In 1949, the company launched the first discounted fares between [[Chicago]] and [[Miami]]. In 1953, the company launched its first international routes after the acquisition of [[Chicago and Southern Air Lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/family-tree/chicago-southern-air-lines|title=Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines|website=www.deltamuseum.org|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428062154/http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/family-tree/chicago-southern-air-lines|archive-date=April 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, it was the first airline to fly the [[Douglas DC-8]].

===Growth and acquisitions===
By 1970, Delta had an all-jet fleet, and in 1972 it acquired [[Northeast Airlines]]. Trans-Atlantic service began in 1978 with the first nonstop flights from Atlanta to [[London]]. In 1981, Delta launched a [[frequent-flyer program]]. In 1987, it acquired [[Western Airlines]], and that same year Delta began trans-Pacific service (Atlanta-Portland, Oregon-Tokyo). In 1990, Delta was the first airline in the United States to fly [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] jets. In 1991, it acquired substantially all of [[Pan Am]]'s trans-Atlantic routes and the Pan Am Shuttle, rebranded as the [[Delta Shuttle]]. Delta was now the leading airline across the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="journey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1920|title=Delta Timeline|last=Delta Flight Museum|website=www.deltamuseum.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414091215/http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/timeline/decades/1920|archive-date=April 14, 2019|access-date=October 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.

Delta often seeks to acquire and utilize older aircraft, especially narrow-bodies, and it has created an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul) organization, called [[Delta TechOps|TechOps]], to support them. However, in early 2011, Delta began talks with Airbus, Boeing and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] to discuss replacing the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]s, [[McDonnell Douglas MD-88]]s, and older [[Airbus A320 family|A320]] and [[757-200]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/17/351072/delta-prepares-for-full-narrowbody-analysis-in-early.html |title=Delta prepares for full narrowbody analysis in early 2011 |first=Lori |last=Ranson |date=December 17, 2011 |work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Business Information |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220043430/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/17/351072/delta-prepares-for-full-narrowbody-analysis-in-early.html |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |access-date=January 15, 2011 |quote=...Delta president Ed Bastian said: "We clearly need to get the DC-9s retired.

Delta One cabins on the [[Boeing 777-200ER]]/[[Boeing 777-200LR|LR]] fleet are configured in a [[herringbone seating|herringbone]] layout, while Airbus A330 cabins (featuring the ''Cirrus'' flat-bed sleeper suite by [[Zodiac Seats U.S.]]) are configured in a reverse herringbone pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/delta/45973/ |title=Delta Revitalizing Boeing 747-400 Fleet with New Interiors |publisher=Multivu.prnewswire.com |date=September 2, 2010 |access-date=July 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425165206/http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/delta/45973/ |archive-date=April 25, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delta Sky Club is the branding name of Delta's airport lounges. Membership is available through an annual membership that can be purchased with either money or miles. International passengers traveling in Delta One class get free access. Membership can also be granted through top-level Delta status or by being an American Express cardholder with certain exceptions. As of January 2019, Delta no longer offers single day passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Delta's Sky Bonus |url=http://www.odysseymediagroup.com/nan/Editorial-Airlines-And-Airports.asp?ReportID=30419 |access-date=February 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207015308/http://www.odysseymediagroup.com/nan/Editorial-Airlines-And-Airports.asp?ReportID=30419 |archive-date=February 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features vary by location but generally include free drinks (including alcoholic beverages), snacks, and reading material. Wi-Fi is free for members and guests and is mostly provided in the US by AT&amp;T.

Originally, Delta's membership-based airport clubs were called Crown Room lounges, with Northwest's called WorldClubs.

=== Delta Global Staffing ===
'''Delta Global Staffing''' (DGS) was a temporary employment firm located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Delta Global Staffing was a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and a division of the internal company [[DAL Global Services]].

Delta Air Lines sold majority ownership of [[DAL Global Services]] to Argenbright Holdings on December 21, 2018. As part of the sale, Delta dissolved the staffing division of DGS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.delta.com/delta-global-services-combine-argenbright-holdings-create-premier-aviation-handling-provider |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-date=April 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200411004453/https://news.delta.com/delta-global-services-combine-argenbright-holdings-create-premier-aviation-handling-provider |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1995 as a provider of temporary staffing for Delta primarily in Atlanta.  DGS has since expanded to include customers and businesses outside the airline and aviation industries. DGS now supports customers in major US metropolitan areas.

Delta Global Staffing provided contract workers for short and long term assignments, VMS partnering, VOP on-site management, temp-to-hire, direct placements, and payroll services. DGS services markets such as call centers, customer services and administrative placements, IT &amp; professional recruiting, logistics, finance &amp; accounting, hospitality, and aviation/airline industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS189559+04-Sep-2008+GNW20080904 |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-date=October 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017145748/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS189559+04-Sep-2008+GNW20080904 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate identity===
[[File:Delta Air Lines A330-323 (N809NW) landing at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (1).jpg|thumb|An Airbus A330-300 painted in Delta's current livery, "Upward &amp; Onward"]]
Delta's logo, often called the "widget", was originally unveiled in 1959. Its triangle shape is taken from the Greek letter [[delta (letter)|delta]], and recalls the airline's origins in the [[Mississippi Delta]].&lt;ref name="Mouawad1"&gt;{{cite news | first=Jad | last=Mouawad | title=On Jet Exteriors, a Parade of Vanilla | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/business/on-the-exterior-of-jetliners-a-parade-of-plain-vanilla.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 23, 2011 | url-access=subscription | access-date=February 7, 2017 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DQw643us?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/business/on-the-exterior-of-jetliners-a-parade-of-plain-vanilla.html?_r=0 | archive-date=January 5, 2013 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also said to be reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the DC-8, Delta's first jet aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.famouslogos.us/delta-airlines-logo/ |title= Delta Air Lines Logo |access-date= July 15, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170313124416/http://www.famouslogos.us/delta-airlines-logo/ |archive-date= March 13, 2017 |url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delta's current [[Aircraft livery|livery]] is called "Upward &amp; Onward". It features a white fuselage with the company's name in blue lettering and a widget on the vertical stabilizer. Delta introduced its current livery in 2007 as part of a re-branding after it emerged from bankruptcy. The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called "colors in motion") used eight. This meant the switch saved the airline money by removing one day from each aircraft's painting cycle. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.&lt;ref name="Mouawad1"/&gt;

===Environmental initiatives===
In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Design for the Environment (DfE) program for its use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.

PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.&lt;ref name="Delta Air Lines News Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Delta Air Lines Accepts EPA Award for Use of Nontoxic Materials on Aircraft|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=22|work=Delta Air Lines News Release|publisher=Delta Air Lines|access-date=March 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929110225/http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=22|archive-date=September 29, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Deltalina}}
As part of the re-branding project, a [[safety video]] featuring a flight attendant showed up on YouTube in early 2008, getting over 1 million views and the attention of news outlets, specifically for the video's tone mixed with the serious safety message. The flight attendant, Katherine Lee, was dubbed "Deltalina" by a member of FlyerTalk for her resemblance to [[Angelina Jolie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.ajc.com/news/who-deltalina-flashback-2008/5WbYDzscytXwoDPjI91uwK/ | title=Who is Deltalina?

===Hijackings===
There have been over a dozen attempted hijackings that resulted in no injuries and the surrender of the often lone hijacker. These incidents are not included. The following are notable hijackings because of fatalities or success in forcing the aircraft to fly to another country:
* On February 21, 1968, a Delta DC-8 was hijacked to Havana, Cuba. This was the first successful hijacking to Cuba from the U.S. since 1961,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and was the start of multiple hijacking attempts to Cuba in the late 1960s. This coincided with the introduction of passenger screening using metal detectors in U.S. airports starting in the late 1960s.
* On July 31, 1972, [[Delta Flight 841]], a Detroit to Miami DC-8 flight, was hijacked to [[Algiers, Algeria]] by 8 hijackers. The aircraft stopped in Boston to pick up an international navigator. The flight was allowed to return with passengers to the U.S., stopping in Barcelona for refueling.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=465514|title=Delta Hijacking|work=[[NBC Nightly News]]|publisher=Vanderbilt Television News Archive|date=August 1, 1972|access-date=January 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010051353/http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=465514|archive-date=October 10, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19720731-0&amp;lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-8 Algiers|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|access-date=March 1, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66UDVH6K1?url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19720731-0&amp;lang=en|archive-date=March 27, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On February 22, 1974, [[Samuel Byck]], an unemployed tire salesman from Pennsylvania, shot and killed an Aviation Police Officer, then stormed aboard [[Delta Air Lines Flight 523]], a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 flight at Baltimore Friendship Airport (now [[Baltimore–Washington International Airport]]) scheduled to fly to Atlanta, and shot both pilots, killing the First Officer, Fred Jones.

The hijacking attempt ended when, after a standoff with police, Byck was shot twice through an aircraft porthole by a Maryland policeman, severely wounding him. Before police stormed the plane, Byck killed himself. The plane never left the gate during this incident.

* On September 13, 1980, a Delta Air Lines New Orleans to Atlanta flight was taken over by two hijackers and forced to fly to Cuba. The flight continued to Atlanta after stopping in Havana. The hijackers were imprisoned by Cuban authorities. One hijacker was released and later sought US residency.

On February 9, 2014, the artists caused controversy at the [[2014 Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]] when LaBeouf arrived at the red carpet wearing a brown paper bag over his head with the words "I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE" written on it.&lt;ref name="BBC-Berlin"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26109348 | title=Actor Shia LaBeouf walks out of Berlin press conference | work=[[BBC News]] | date=February 9, 2014 | access-date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation conducted as part of the trio's ''#INTERVIEW'' piece in November 2014, LaBeouf said that he was "heartbroken" and "genuinely remorseful and full of shame and guilt" at the start of their subsequent ''#IAMSORRY'' performance, in which he occupied a Los Angeles gallery for six days wearing the paper bag and silently crying in front of visitors, but that "in the end I felt cared for however it came—it was beautiful, it blew me away."&lt;ref name=Dazed-Iamsorry /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-iamsorry"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/14/shia-labeouf-iamsorry-exhibit-media-manipulation | title=I don't know if Shia LaBeouf is sorry, but he's a master image transformer | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=February 14, 2014 | access-date=July 14, 2014 | author=Eordogh, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://labeoufronkkoturner.com/interview/ | title=#INTERVIEW | access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He revealed, however, that one woman had proceeded to [[Sexual assault|sexually assault]] him during the February performance,&lt;ref name="Atlantic-sorry"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/why-its-hard-to-talk-about-shia-labeoufs-alleged-rape/383304/ | title=The Messed-Up Ways People Talk About Shia LaBeouf's Alleged Rape | magazine=[[The Atlantic]] | date=December 2, 2014 | access-date=December 27, 2016 | author=Cruz, L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Rönkkö and Turner later clarified that they had prevented the assault by intervening as soon as they were aware of the incident starting to occur.&lt;ref name="RollingStone-movies"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/why-shia-labeoufs-latest-stunt-is-a-work-of-genius-20151111 | title=Why Shia LaBeouf's Latest Stunt Is a Work of Genius | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=November 11, 2015 | access-date=December 27, 2016 | author=Ehrlich, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artists speak up about Shia LaBeouf's rape|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/shia-labeouf-collaborators-weigh-in-actor-rape-claim-article-1.2028796|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|access-date=December 11, 2014|date=December 1, 2014|author=Caulfield, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, LaBeouf appeared in ''[[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner#.23INTRODUCTIONS.2C 2015|#INTRODUCTIONS]]'', a half-hour video made by LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner in collaboration with [[Central Saint Martins]] Fine Art students, comprising a series of short monologues performed by LaBeouf in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo-introductions"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/the-real-story-behind-shia-labeoufs-hilarious-120497282774.html | title=The Real Story Behind Shia LaBeouf's Hilarious 'Motivational' Rant | website=[[Yahoo]] | date=June 2, 2015 | access-date=December 27, 2016 | author=Pogue, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One segment in the form of an exaggerated motivational speech,&lt;ref name="Vox-doit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8725089/shia-labeouf-motivational-speech | title=Shia LaBeouf's extremely loud motivational speech, explained | website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] | date=June 3, 2015 | access-date=December 27, 2016 | author=Edwards, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; dubbed "Just Do It" after the [[Just Do It|Nike slogan]], became an [[Internet meme]] after going [[Viral video|viral]] within days of being released, spawning numerous remixes and parodies, and becoming the most searched for [[GIF]] of 2015 according to [[Google]].&lt;ref name="PM-Gif"&gt;{{cite magazine| first=Diana|last=Bruk|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/web/news/a18587/most-googled-gifs-of-2015/ | title=Here Are the 10 Gifs that Defined 2015 | magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] | date=December 18, 2015 | access-date=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf released his short film ''[[Howard Cantour.com]]'' to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to ''Justin M. Damiano'', a 2007 comic by ''[[Ghost World (comics)|Ghost World]]'' creator [[Dan Clowes]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|title=Shia LaBeouf apologizes for 'copying' film idea|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/16/shia-labeouf-short-film-pulled/4046819|newspaper=USA Today|date=December 16, 2013|access-date=January 4, 2014|first1=Trey|last1=Barrineau}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' journalist Graeme McMillan noted at least three similarities in their article, one of which was that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|title=Shia LaBeouf Accused of Plagiarizing Cartoonist in Short Film|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/12/shia-labeouf-dan-clowes-comic|magazine=Wired|access-date=January 3, 2014|date=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead "inspired" by him and "got lost in the creative process."&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt; He followed this up with several apologies via [[Twitter]] writing, "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shia LaBeouf Apologizes After Plagiarizing Artist Daniel Clowes For His New Short Film|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/shia-labeouf-rip-off-daniel-clowes-howard-cantour?bftw|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on [[Yahoo! Answers]].&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=Shia LaBeouf plagiarizes Daniel Clowes comic for his film, responds with plagiarized apology|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/shia-labeouf-plagiarizes-daniel-clowes-comic-for-h-106565|access-date=December 18, 2013|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the initial discovery of the plagiarism of Clowe's work, LaBeouf's other work has come under scrutiny. News outlets reported that LaBeouf's graphic novels, ''Let's Fucking Party'' and ''Stale N Mate'', had been plagiarized from [[Benoît Duteurtre]]'s ''The Little Girl and the Cigarette'' and [[Charles Bukowski]]'s ''Assault''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shia LaBeouf Appears to Have Also Plagiarized Passages by Bukowski and Other Authors|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/18/shia-labeouf-appears-to-have-also-plagiarized-passages-by-bukowski-and-other-authors|website=[[IGN]]|date=December 18, 2013|access-date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shia LaBeouf Seemingly Copied Bukowski, Others For His Own Comic Books|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/shia-labeouf-copied-charles-bukowski-others-comic-books|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|title=Shia LaBeouf Seemingly Copied Bukowski, Others For His Own Comic Books|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/shia-labeouf-copied-charles-bukowski-others-comic-books|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=December 18, 2013|date=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, LaBeouf spoke about the plagiarism accusations with ''[[Bleeding Cool]]'' writer [[Rich Johnston]], where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and that they did not allow for ideas to flow freely.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web|title="Authorship Is Censorship" – Bleeding Cool In Conversation With Shia LaBeouf|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/01/02/authorship-is-censorship-bleeding-cool-in-conversation-with-shia-labeouf|work=Bleeding Cool|date=January 2, 2014|access-date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project, ''Daniel Boring'' (a reference to ''[[David Boring]]'', another comic created by Clowes). The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Brent|url=http://www.thewrap.com/shia-labeouf-hit-cease-desist-letter-allegedly-plagiarizing-daniel-clowes|title=Shia LaBeouf Hit With Cease and Desist Letter for Allegedly Plagiarizing Daniel Clowes -- Again|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=January 8, 2014|access-date=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
LaBeouf contributed an essay to the book ''I Am Jewish'', by [[Judea Pearl]], in which he stated that he has a "personal relationship with God that happens to work within the confines of Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jalil|first1=Justin|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-born-shia-lebeouf-now-a-christian/#gs.gk32js|title=Shia LeBeouf now a Christian|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=October 23, 2014|access-date=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has described himself as Jewish,&lt;ref name="indiel" /&gt; but declared in 2007 that religion had "never made sense" to him.&lt;ref name="refjuly07" /&gt; However, he said in an interview in ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine in October 2014 that he had become "a [[Christians|Christian]] man".&lt;ref name=IntvwMag&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elvis|title=Shia LaBeouf|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/shia-labeouf/|magazine=[[Interview Magazine]]|access-date=October 21, 2014|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/honey-boy-script-shia-labeouf-movie-screenplay-1202811929/|title='Honey Boy': Read Shia LaBeouf's Screenplay For His Amazon Studios Drama|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 17, 2019|access-date=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He met his co-star and later girlfriend, English actress [[Mia Goth]], while filming ''Nymphomaniac'' in 2012. On October 10, 2016, LaBeouf and Goth appeared to have gotten married in a Las Vegas ceremony officiated by an Elvis impersonator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/shia-lebeouf-and-mia-goth-got-hitched-in-vegas.html|title=Shia LaBeouf and Mia Goth Got Married in Vegas With the Help of an Elvis Impersonator, and Of Course There's a Video|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=October 10, 2016|access-date=September 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, a local official said that the pair were not legally married, but instead a commitment ceremony was performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://people.com/movies/shia-labeouf-and-mia-goth-are-not-legally-married-vegas-clerk-confirms/|title=Shia LaBeouf and Mia Goth Are Not Legally Married, Local Officials Confirm|last=Miller|first=Mike|date=October 13, 2016|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|access-date=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, LaBeouf confirmed their nuptials on ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/movies/shia-labeouf-confirms-hes-a-married-man-were-proud-of-it-it-was-love/|title=Shia LaBeouf Confirms He's a Married Man: 'We're Proud of It — It Was Love'|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Jodi|last=Guglielmi|date=October 18, 2016|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, it was announced the couple had [[Legal separation|separated]] and filed for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/news/2018/09/26/shia-labeouf-mia-goth-divorce/|title=Shia LaBeouf and Mia Goth file for divorce|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Alexia|last=Fernandez|date=September 26, 2018|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, LaBeouf endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[2015 Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign|campaign]] in the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Labour Party leadership election]]. He told the ''[[Evening Standard]]'': "I like Jeremy Corbyn. I like him in every way.

'''Donald John Trump''' (born June 14, 1946) is an American [[Media career of Donald Trump|media personality]], [[Business career of Donald Trump|businessman]], and politician who served as the 45th [[president of the United States]] from 2017 to 2021.

Born and raised in [[Queens]], New York City, Trump attended [[Fordham University]] for two years and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in economics from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. He became the president of his father [[Fred Trump]]'s&lt;!--Don't rephrase unless you understand how commas and apostrophes work--&gt; real estate business in 1971, and renamed it to [[The Trump Organization]]. Trump expanded the company's operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He later started [[The Trump Organization#Other ventures and investments|various side ventures]], mostly by licensing his name. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal [[Legal affairs of Donald Trump|legal actions]], including six bankruptcies. He owned the [[Miss Universe]] brand of beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015 and produced and hosted the reality television series ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' from 2004 to 2015.

[[Political positions of Donald Trump|Trump's political positions]] have been described as [[populist]], [[protectionist]], [[isolationist]], and [[nationalist]]. He entered the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential race]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and was elected in an [[upset victory]] over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] while [[List of United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|losing the popular vote]].{{efn|name=electoral-college|Presidential elections in the United States are decided by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and (in most states) all delegates vote for the winner of the local state vote. Consequently, it is possible for the [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]] to have received fewer votes from the country's total population (the popular vote). [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|This situation has occurred four times in the modern two-party system, each time favoring the Republican]].}} He became the first U.S. president without [[List of presidents of the United States by previous experience|prior military or government service]]. His election and policies sparked [[Protests against Donald Trump|numerous protests]].&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 20. --&gt; Trump made [[Veracity of statements by Donald Trump|many false and misleading statements]] during his campaigns and [[Presidency of Donald Trump|presidency]], to a degree unprecedented in American politics.&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 49. --&gt; Many of his comments and actions have been [[Racial views of Donald Trump|characterized as racially charged or racist]].&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 30. --&gt;

During his presidency, Trump ordered [[Executive Order 13769|a travel ban]] on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after [[Legal challenges to the Trump travel ban|legal challenges]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld [[Presidential Proclamation 9645|the policy's third revision]].&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence IN ANY WAY without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 23. --&gt; He enacted [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|a tax-cut package]] for individuals and businesses, rescinding the [[individual shared responsibility provision|individual health insurance mandate]] penalty of the [[Affordable Care Act]]. He signed [[First Step Act|criminal justice reform]] and appointed [[Neil Gorsuch]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]] and [[Amy Coney Barrett]] to the Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]], ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in [[Trump administration communication during the COVID-19 pandemic|his messaging]], and [[Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic by the United States|promoted misinformation]] about unproven treatments and the availability of testing.  In foreign policy, Trump pursued an [[America First (policy)#Presidency of Donald Trump|America First]] agenda: he renegotiated the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as the [[U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement]], withdrew the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade negotiations, the [[Paris Agreement]] on [[climate change]] and the [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]], and [[Trump tariffs|imposed import tariffs]] that triggered [[China–United States trade war|a trade war with China]]. In the [[MENA|Middle East and Northern Africa]], he [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel|moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem]], negotiated the [[Abraham Accords]] and additional agreements between Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab World]], and [[American-led intervention in the Syrian civil war#Withdrawal from north Syria|withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria]] and [[American military intervention in Somalia (2007–present)|Somalia]]. He met three times with North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]]; [[2018–20 Korean peace process|negotiations on denuclearization]] eventually broke down.

A [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|special counsel investigation]] led by [[Robert Mueller]] found that Trump and his campaign benefited from [[Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election]], but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of [[criminal conspiracy]] or coordination with Russia.{{efn|name=coordination|Mueller, Robert (March 2019). [https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf "Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election"]. '''I'''. p. 2. "In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign 'coordinat[ed]'{{snd}}a term that appears in the appointment order{{snd}}with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, 'coordination' does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement{{snd}}tacit or express{{snd}}between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."}} Mueller also investigated Trump for [[obstruction of justice]] and [[Mueller Report|his report]] neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump [[Trump–Ukraine scandal|solicited Ukraine to investigate]] his political rival [[Joe Biden]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] [[First impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached him]] in December 2019 for [[abuse of power]] and [[Contempt of Congress|obstruction]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[First impeachment trial of Donald Trump|acquitted him]] of both charges in February 2020. &lt;!-- PLEASE DISCUSS BEFORE CHANGING THIS LANGUAGE. --&gt;

Trump lost the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]] to Biden, but refused to concede defeat. He [[Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election|attempted to overturn the results]] by making false claims of electoral fraud, pressuring government officials, mounting scores of [[List of lawsuits relating to the 2020 United States presidential election|unsuccessful legal challenges]] and obstructing the [[Presidential transition of Joe Biden|presidential transition]]. On the day [[2021 United States Electoral College vote count|Congress met to tally the electoral votes]], January 6, 2021, Trump rallied his supporters and told them to march to the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]]. They did and [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|stormed it]], resulting in the deaths of five people and forcing Congress to evacuate. Seven days later, the House [[Second impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached him]] for [[incitement of insurrection]], making him the only federal officeholder in American history to be impeached twice. The Senate [[Second impeachment trial of Donald Trump|acquitted Trump]] on February 13, 2021.

Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion over the ten-year period, in contrast to his claims about his financial health and business abilities. ''The New York Times'' reported that "year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer" and that Trump's "core business losses in 1990 and 1991—more than $250 million each year—were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years." In 1995 his reported losses were $915.7 million.&lt;ref name=Buettner-190508&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html|title=Decade in the Red: Trump Tax Figures Show Over $1 Billion in Business Losses|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 8, 2019|access-date=May 8, 2019|first1=Russ|last1=Buettner|first2=Susanne|last2=Craig|author2link=Susanne Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/trump-taxes/588967/|title=The Secret That Was Hiding in Trump's Taxes|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=May 8, 2019|access-date=May 8, 2019|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|author-link=Conor Friedersdorf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a September 2020 analysis by ''[[The New York Times]]'' of twenty years of data from Trump's [[tax returns]], Trump had accumulated hundreds of millions in losses and deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income.&lt;ref name="Buettner 2020-09-27"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buettner|first1=Russ|last2=Craig|first2=Susanne|author2link=Susanne Craig|last3=McIntire|first3=Mike|date=September 27, 2020|title=Trump's Taxes Show Chronic Losses and Years of Income Tax Avoidance|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html|access-date=September 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the analysis, Trump's main sources of income were his share of revenue from ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' and income from businesses in which he was a minority partner, while his majority-owned businesses were largely running at losses.&lt;ref name="Buettner 2020-09-27"/&gt; A significant portion of Trump's income was in [[tax credit]]s due to his losses, which enables him to avoid paying income tax, or paying as little as $750, for several years.&lt;ref name="Buettner 2020-09-27"/&gt; Over the past decade, Trump has been balancing his businesses' losses by selling and taking out loans against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on [[Trump Tower]] (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds.&lt;ref name="Buettner 2020-09-27"/&gt; Trump has personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due to be repaid by 2024. The tax records also showed Trump had unsuccessfully pursued business deals in China, including by developing a partnership with a major government-controlled company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/trump-tax-records-china-f086bba3b691acdc51535412f77f2c8e|title=Report: Tax records show Trump tried to land China projects|date=October 21, 2020|website=[[AP News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump has a total of over $1 billion in debts, borrowed to finance his assets, reported ''Forbes'' in October 2020. Around $640 million or more was owed to various banks and trust organizations. Around $450 million was owed to unknown creditors.

Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict [[Grand Hyatt New York|Commodore Hotel]], adjacent to [[Grand Central Terminal]].

In 1984, Trump opened [[Harrah's at Trump Plaza]], a hotel and casino in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump as president approved large increases in government spending, as well as the 2017 tax cut.

On January 27, 2017, Trump signed [[Executive Order 13769]], which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns.

On December 22, 2018, the federal government was partially shut down after Trump declared that any funding extension must include $5.6 billion in federal funds for a [[Trump border wall|U.S.–Mexico border wall]] to partly fulfill his campaign promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Julie Hirschfeld|last1=Davis|author1link=Julie Hirschfeld Davis|first2=Michael|last2=Tackett|author2link=Michael Tackett|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-congress-shutdown.html|title=Trump and Democrats Dig in After Talks to Reopen Government Go Nowhere|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shutdown was caused by a lapse in funding for nine federal departments, affecting about one-fourth of federal government activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wamsley|first=Laurel|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683642605/how-is-the-shutdown-affecting-america-let-us-count-the-ways|title=How Is The Shutdown Affecting America?

On January 25, 2019, Congress unanimously approved a temporary funding bill that provided no funds for the wall but would provide delayed paychecks to government workers. Trump signed the bill that day, ending the shutdown at 35 days. It was the [[List of United States federal funding gaps|longest U.S. government shutdown in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gambino|first1=Lauren|last2=Walters|first2=Joanna|title=Trump signs bill to end $6bn shutdown and temporarily reopen government|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/25/shutdown-latest-news-trump-reopens-government-deal-democrats|access-date=May 31, 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 26, 2019|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pramuk|first=Jacob|title=Trump signs bill to temporarily reopen government after longest shutdown in history|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/senate-votes-to-reopen-government-and-end-shutdown-without-border-wall.html|access-date=May 31, 2020|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=January 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the government funding was temporary, another shutdown loomed.

==== National emergency regarding the southern border ====

On February 15, 2019, after Trump received from Congress only $1.375 billion for border fencing after demanding $5.7 billion for the Trump wall, he declared a [[National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States]] in hopes of getting another $6.7 billion without congressional approval, using funds for military construction, [[drug interdiction]], and money from the Treasury.&lt;ref name=Wilkie/&gt; In doing so, Trump acknowledged that he "didn't need to" declare a national emergency, but he "would rather do it much faster."&lt;ref name=Wilkie/&gt;

Congress twice passed resolutions to block Trump's national emergency declarations, but Trump vetoed both and there were not enough votes in Congress for a [[veto override]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fabian|first=Jordan|title=Trump issues first veto, warning of 'reckless' resolution|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/434212-trump-issues-first-veto-on-emergency-declaration|access-date=May 31, 2020|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=March 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montoya-Galvez|first=Camilo|title=Attempt to override Trump veto on national emergency resolution fails in House|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attempt-to-override-trump-veto-on-national-emergency-resolution-fails-in-house/|access-date=May 31, 2020|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=March 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carney|first=Jordain|title=Senate fails to override Trump veto over emergency declaration|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/466313-senate-fails-to-override-trumps-emergency-declaration-veto|access-date=May 31, 2020|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's decision to divert other government funding to fund the wall resulted in legal challenges.

As president, Trump disparaged courts and judges whom he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority.

Trump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements.

In September 2019, the Trump administration terminated [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID's]] [[PREDICT (USAID)|PREDICT]] program, a $200 million [[epidemiological]] research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Zachary|last=Cohen|date=April 10, 2020|access-date=July 10, 2020|title=Trump administration shuttered pandemic monitoring program, then scrambled to extend it|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/politics/trump-usaid-prevent-program-coronavirus/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McNeil|first=Donald G.

In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases "makes us look bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/trump-says-us-would-have-half-the-number-of-coronavirus-cases-if-it-did-half-the-testing.html|title=Trump says U.S. would have half the number of coronavirus cases if it did half the testing|last=Higgins-Dunn|first=Noah|date=July 14, 2020|publisher=[[CNBC]]|access-date=August 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/23/trumps-right-that-with-less-testing-we-record-fewer-cases-fact-thats-already-happening/|title=Trump is right that with lower testing, we record fewer cases.

=== Popular culture ===

{{Main|Donald Trump in popular culture|Donald Trump in music}}

Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature. He has been parodied regularly on [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Donald Trump|''Saturday Night Live'']] by [[Phil Hartman]], [[Darrell Hammond]], and [[Alec Baldwin]] and in ''[[South Park]]'' as [[Mr. Garrison]]. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Bart to the Future]]"—written during his [[Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign|2000 campaign for the Reform Party]]—anticipated a Trump presidency. Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of [[hip-hop]] lyrics since the 1980s; he was named in hundreds of songs, most often with a positive tone.&lt;ref name=538-hiphop&gt;{{cite news|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/clinton-trump-hip-hop-lyrics|title=Hip-Hop Is Turning On Donald Trump|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|date=July 14, 2016|first=Allison|last=McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentions of Trump in hip-hop turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.&lt;ref name=538-hiphop/&gt;
